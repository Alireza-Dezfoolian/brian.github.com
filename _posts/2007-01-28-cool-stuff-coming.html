<p>Many of you have posted kind words about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">The Blogging Church</a> on Amazon or in blog posts. I really appreciate everyone who has purchased the book and taken the time to read it. I hope it has sparked ideas and that you've found it truly helpful. And more than anything else, I hope it's fun to read, whether you find yourself agreeing or disagreeing. One of the nicest comments I've heard was from a staff member of a church in California who read the book and loved it. Then his wife picked it up and enjoyed it as well. That makes me happy because I don't want the book to seem like it is written for a narrow audience of male geeks. Whether you are on staff at a church or a committed member, a longtime blogger or someone who generally avoids technology, male or female, I think you'll enjoy the journey of the book and gain a new perspective and loads of information along the way.</p>
<p>Here's the latest news...</p>

<p>The official press release is being finalized right now. Jossey-Bass will be sending the book and the release to a ton of media organizations, both religious and otherwise. I have no idea what the
response will be, but it sounds cool!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leadnet.org">Leadership Network</a> is about to launch its campaign for the book, including a slick email and three minute promo video. I'll let you know when you can check it
out.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.anotherstorm.com/">Rick Scheibner</a> just posted his review of the book. He shares his favorite chapter, least favorite chapter, and a lot more interesting feedback.</p>
<blockquote>Eminently readable at 183 pages, this book explores the logistics and theories behind the art of blogging.  Although it&rsquo;s written with church communications in mind, there is plenty of information here for anybody who wishes to put blogging to work for them.</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.anotherstorm.com/2007/01/28/the-blogging-church-book-review/">read the full review here</a>.</p>
<p>Tony Morgan <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tonymorganlive.com/tony_morgan_one_of_the_si/2007/01/amazon_delivers.html">received his copy</a> of the book last week. He hasn't read it yet, so for now you'll have to settle for some cool pictures and his review of the &quot;beautiful blue cover.&quot;</p>

<p>I have a fun contest to announce. Details coming soon!<br /> </p>
