<p><a href="http://www.masternewmedia.org/news/2004/12/05/the_death_of_the_home.htm">Robin Good points</a> to another must-read article<a href="http://www.digital-web.com/">&nbsp;</a>: <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/articles/home_alone_content_aggregators">Home Alone? How Content Aggregators Change Navigation and Control of Content</a>. The author, Joshua Porter, asks the question: <em><br /></em></p><blockquote><p>Should we be concerned that aggregators are increasingly allowing users to find their own ways to use our content how they see fit? Aggregators are promoting a shift in the control of content. Theyâ€™re challenging the idea that we as designers control public access to information in our domains, that users must view things in the way we prescribe, and that our hierarchy is best to present our content.</p></blockquote><p>The article is from <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/">Digital Web Magazine</a>. I was not aware of Digital Web until I came across Robin's post and I'm happy to report that it looks to be a fantastic resource with a high-number of thought-provoking articles. I have been searching for a web design/information architect home and this may be it.</p>
