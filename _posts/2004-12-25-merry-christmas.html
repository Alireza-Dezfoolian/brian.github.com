<p>We had wonderful, blessed Christmas morning together as a family. The house was so peaceful as we gathered in front of the tree. On Christmas Eve, we continued our family traditions, first <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2004/11/start_your_own_.html">finishing <em>Rascal</em></a>, then Ben reading the entire Advent chain from start to finish, followed by Lori reading Ben <em>The Night Before Christmas</em>, and, finally, opening a single present. </p>





<p>Ben is the most patient, centered child you could imagine, allowing us a few minutes to struggle out of bed after <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2004/12/like_no_other_c.html">a very long day</a>. He absolutely loves giving and receiving presents and his joy is infectious, but he seems completely devoid of intense want or greed. Even at nine, he does not produce a detailed Christmas list or have any preconceived ideas of what should be under the tree. He is full of trust and so incredibly content, a smiling example to me everyday.<br /><br />This Christmas will be remembered as the year Ben received his first computer, a <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">new G5 iMac</a>. Of course, this is truly a family computer, but he will clearly be its primary user. I can't imagine him being more excited about a gift and he has already set out to master it, teaching me something, in fact, within his first hour. It doesn't appear he will have any difficulty transferring his PC skills to the Mac.</p>

<p>As to the iMac, it is everything you've heard and more. I certainly have never seen a more beautiful computer; it is indeed a work of art. Within an hour, we had it up and running, on the web, and Ben was customizing his screen saver. Now we start the long process of moving pictures and music to our new digital hub.</p>

<p>I hope all of you have had a wonderful day, sharing the love of Christ with friends and family. Merry Christmas!</p>
