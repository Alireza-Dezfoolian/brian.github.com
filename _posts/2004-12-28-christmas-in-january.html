<p><a href="http://www.thinksecret.com">Think Secret</a> has posted two batches of Macworld San Francisco reports, one interesting, one stunning. First, Steve Jobs' <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0412expo1.html">January keynote should feature the debut of iLife '05</a>, with significant upgrades to nearly the entire suite, especially iMovie and GarageBand. The debut should also include the long-awaited upgrade to Keynote, the Mac-only presentation software. </p>

<p>More importantly, Think Secret is reporting that January will <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0412expo2.html">feature a sub-$500 G4 Macintosh</a>, available without a monitor! Designed to appeal to PC iPod users looking to experiment with the Mac platform, the unit will be small and feature middle-of-the-road performance. This will open up the world of Apple to another group of users who are put off by the base entry price and who would like to purchase a Mac while using an existing monitor. </p>

<p>If the Expo features a flash-based iPod as well, this could be an about-face Macworld for Apple.</p>

<p>[Reminder: though I trust Think Secret more than any other Mac rumor site, all of this remains, at this point, rumor only.]</p>
