<p><b>1.</b> Dave Winer released the public beta of his <b>OPML Editor</b>. It's a very cool outliner, programming tool, and blog publisher. Currently Windows-only, it is built on the familiar Frontier/Radio foundation and can be taken in many different directions, including managing directories of information in a shared form. The podcasting community currently makes heavy use of OPML, as do most RSS newsreaders for subscription lists. I'm having a lot of fun experimenting with it.

<p><b>2.</b> The U.S. Men's National Team beat Panama Sunday to with the Gold Cup, a bi-annual soccer tournament featuring North and Central American national teams. Kasey Keller once again proved himself to be one of the best goalies in the world. [<a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/feature?id=337550&amp;cc=5901">Link</a>] </p>

<p><b>3. Mille Borne</b> is easily one of the best family card games. I've never played it with someone who didn't love it, whether a child or adult. I used to play it regularly when I was a teenager and Ben and I rediscovered it this weekend. <i>Great fun!</i> [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00004SDAP/ref=ord_cart_shr/102-8885107-0490535?%5Fencoding=UTF8&m=A3UN6WX5RRO2AG&v=glance">Link</a>]<br />

<p><b>4. 15 Mbps</b> of pure bandwidth goodness is only two weeks away! Thanks to the wonderful world of fiber and Verizon Fios, our home will soon have 4x the internet connection for $2 less per month.

<p><b>5.</b> The incredible, though now defunct, band Phish had a rare combination of relentless creativity and musicianship. One of the most unique things they did for years involved their annual Halloween shows. Following in the tradition of the Grateful Dead, the Halloween shows were a true event. Phish came up with a brilliant way to make it memorable.<br />
<p>In the middle of a marathon night of music, the band would put on a <i>musical costume</i> and perform an entire album from another band as part of the show. This was in addition to nearly two full sets of original music. The performances are fascinating for their enthusiam and dedication to music that obviously meant a great deal to them.<br>
<p>The albums chosen include <i>Loaded</i> by Velvet Underground, <i>The White Album</i> by The Beatles, <i>Remain in the Light</i> by The Talking Heads, and my absolute favorite, <i>Quadrophenia</i> by The Who. <br>
<p>They released these four shows on CD a couple of years ago (Live Phish #13, 14, 15 and 16), but I only just discovered them. They are fantastic!. [<a href="http://www.phish.com/releases/?order=title">Link</a>]</p>
