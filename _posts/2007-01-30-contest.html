<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">The Blogging Church</a> is easily available online, but it should theoretically start showing up in local bookstores. Christian bookstores are the more likely destination, but Borders and Barnes & Noble may be stocking a few copies as well. </p>

<p>I want proof.</p>

<p>As much as I love Amazon, there's just something different about seeing the book for sale in a physical bookstore.</p>

<p>The first person to send me a picture of <em>The Blogging Church</em> for sale in an actual bookstore will receive a <strong>$20 gift certificate</strong> - your choice of either <strong>Amazon</strong> or <strong>iTunes</strong>.</p>

<p>You are in no way obligated to actually buy the book, but you are not allowed to take your own copy into a bookstore, take a picture, and leave (you know who you are). And while you're asking around at your local bookstores, you might as well suggest that they carry the book if they don't already. It's always good to have a tiebreaker just in case.</p>

<p>Ready? Go!</p>
