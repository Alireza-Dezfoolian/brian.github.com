<p>Google has released <a href="http://desktop.google.com/">Google Desktop</a>, a local app accessible through a browser that indexes your harddrive, including email, and its content for quick and easy searches. The initial version is somewhat limited as it only indexes data from Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, and Internet Explorer. This version is also not available for Mac OS X, which may be intentional as Apple is building similar functionality into next year's <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/">Tiger</a> release.</p>

<p>If you live in a primarily Microsoft/PC world, however, I find it works very well; exactly what you'd expect from Google.</p>
