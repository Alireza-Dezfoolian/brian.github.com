<p>Two great political reads on the upcoming election: the latest edition of the <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/sep/sep23.html">Electoral Vote Predictor</a> has terrific data, as well as a fascinating discussion on the possibilities and implications of a tied electoral college (including Colorado's ballot initiative to distribute electoral votes in proportion to the vote total, instead of all-or-nothing).</p>

<p>The second item is a very optimistic <em>Washington Time's</em> <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20040923-122118-6902r.htm">interview with Karl Rove</a> [via <a href="http://politicalwire.com/">Political Wire</a>].  Obviously, the strong confidence is expected, but it is indeed telling that the Kerry campaign continues to cancel advertising buys in a number of states.</p>

<p>These sites are two of the best places to track the latest election news. <i>Highly recommended!</i></p>
