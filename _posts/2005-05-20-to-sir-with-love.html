<p>You never forget that special someone, do you? The one that makes you feel different than you've ever felt before. That sweet person who makes you feel...</p>

<p>Old.</p>

<p>I had one of those shared moments recently. I went with the family to visit some friends who have a live-in nanny. Lindsay is a very sweet 23-year old who is fantastic with kids. We had met a couple of times previously, so when she walked toward the house, I casually said, &quot;Hey! How's it going Lindsay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Great!&quot; she smiled. &quot;It's good to see you, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>Sir?</p>

<p>Did she just call me <em>sir</em>? Yes, it was unmistakenly <em>sir</em>.</p>

<p>She walked into the house and I smiled knowing that Lindsay would forever be my first. The first person to call me sir based entirely on a perceptive grasp of our age difference. This was not the sir of a well-trained child or an employee, this was the sir of an adult speaking respectively to an older adult.</p>

<p>Since I am very nearly 35 years old, I am certainly entitled to be called sir. I think I began to think I was immune to such things, as I was told for years that I look young for my age. Now that I think of it, no one has said that for a long time.</p>

<p>So, I finally have my <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2004/10/top_10_signs_th.html">11th sign that I'm no longer young</a>. And to Linday I say, thanks for smiling when you said it - it hardly seemed like a bad thing at all.</p>
