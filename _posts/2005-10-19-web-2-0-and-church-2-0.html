<p>We're looking for two talented, driven, and visionary people to add to our small web team. Are you someone who is passionate about web design, code, and the local church? We have two positions available - designer and developer.</p>

<p>What does Web 2.0 look like in the local church? What does the next-generation church look like online? Let's find out!</p>

<p>Do you love PHP, CSS, Linux and simple, friendly websites that make you smile? Join us! Your first job will be to help build a brand-new <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com">FellowshipChurch.com</a>. We're still looking for <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/10/looking_for_tal.html">volunteers and contractors</a> as well, so even if you aren't available for full-time employment, we still want you to be part of the fun ahead.</p>
