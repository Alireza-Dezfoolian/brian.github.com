<p>I spent an hour on the phone yesterday with <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0107946/">Ed Cone</a>. Ed is a writer for <a href="http://cioinsight.com/">CIO Insight</a> magazine and is interviewing a couple of churches about how we use the web and technology.</p>

<p>Of course, in the blogosphere, Ed may be better known for his role in North Carolina grass-roots politics and a number of cool conferences, including this weekend's <a href="http://2005.convergesouth.com/default.asp">Converge South</a>.</p>

<p>After reading <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0107946">his blog</a> and hearing <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Dave</a> talk about him for the past couple of years, it was a real privilege to finally speak with Ed. He's a great guy and asks some terrific questions.</p>

<p>We'll see if his article finds its way to print and whether anything I said survives the editor's pen. I thought I definitely could've done a better job. I think he wanted more of a forest view and I may been staring at too many trees yesterday.</p>

<p>Thanks for the opportunity, Ed. Let me know if I can fill in some more blanks (we ran out of time before we could even <a href="http://www.bloggingchurch.com">discuss blogging in the church</a>). Have a great conference and best of luck with your article!</p>
