<p>Will <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> <strong>ever</strong> update the PowerBook and PowerMac lines? This has been one of the quietest quarters at Apple in a long time. Almost as significant, I don't remember when I have seen the homepage remain the same for this long. Of course, this can only mean that great things are just around the corner, right?</p>
