<p>I've written a number of times about my quest for programming or game making software for my son, Ben. My dream is to find a tool that will allow him to build games without learning a lot of code. I want him to be able to let his imagination go crazy while he gets familiar with game concepts. At his age, I don't want him to struggle with code until he's comfortable with the various pieces of the puzzle.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, we found an incredible solution. <a href="http://www.sawbladesoftware.com/">Power Game Factory</a> by Sawblade Software. This is one of the coolest pieces of software I have ever seen. It allows you to build incredibly fun and realistic games simply by making choices. You can be as simple or complex as you like. Each character or object within the software has a wide range of settings and options attached to it. </p>

<p>The default theme centers around snowmen that attack you with snowballs, so you get a general idea of how much fun it is. </p>

<p>Ben has used the software for hours already while creating multiple levels of his very own game. For the first time, he's able to try nearly every wacky computer game idea he's ever had (what if my lightsaber was 2-feet wide?) and learn through simple trial and error. He loves it!</p>

<p>Here's <a href="http://www.apple.com/games/articles/2005/08/gamebuildingtools/">a great article from Apple.com</a> on Power Game Factory and other Mac game building tools. Did I mention it is only available for the Mac?</p>

<p>Here are two final things that have blown me away. First, this software costs a grand total of <strong>$44</strong>, which even includes physical delivery! </p>

<p>Second, I ordered the game on a Friday afternoon, but then found out that it came on CD, which we wouldn't get for about a week. I contacted the developer, Jesse Simko, to see if there was another option since Ben was hoping to play with it all weekend. Within an hour, I had a special link to an electronic version and Ben had a blast all weekend. I was, and am, truly impressed.</p>
