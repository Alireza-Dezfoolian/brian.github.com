<p>Todd Sattersten at the <a href="http://www.apennyfor.com">A Penny For</a> site has started a great end-of-year project, highlighting the previous year's top 24 posts. A number of sites have submitted their lists and he has gathered them <a href="http://apennyfor.com/top24/">together in one place</a> for all to see. I decided to browse through the past nine months (I started in April) and choose the 24 posts that I thought were most interesting, original, or noteworthy. If you have come across this site recently, you may find a few worthwhile reads below. <em>Enjoy!</em></p>
