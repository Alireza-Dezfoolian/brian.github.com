<p><a href="http://www.feedburner.com">Feedburner</a>, which hosts the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/LeaveItBehind">weblog feed (RSS)</a> for this site, recently added a chart to the stats page. The chart represents the overall percentage of each newsreader that is used to access Leave it Behind. Here's the breakdown:</p>

<p>19% <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a></p>

<p>16% <a href="http://www.newsgator.com">Newsgator</a></p>

<p>16% <a href="http://www.newsgator.com">Newsgator Online</a></p>

<p>14% <a href="http://www.sharpreader.com/">SharpReader</a></p>

<p>11% <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a></p>

<p>07% <a href="http://www.rssbandit.org/">RSS Bandit</a></p>

<p>17% Other</p>

<p>I'm not terribly surprised about Bloglines, but Newsgator's popularity, which could easily count as 32%, did catch me off guard. I also would have expected NetNewsWire to finish ahead of SharpReader. I'll be interested to see how these fluctuate over time.</p>

<p>One idea that has always interested me is whether <a href="http://www.sixapart.com">Six Apart</a> will build a newsreader into <a href="http://www.typepad.com">TypePad</a>. I doubt it would be difficult to add a tab to the TypePad interface and allow the user to read <strong>and</strong> post from a single site. Of course, posting to your TypePad blog from <strong>TypeNews</strong> would only require a single click and no configuration if posting to your default weblog. I think a very large percentage of TypePad users would find that combination hard to resist.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.burningdoor.com/feedburner/archives/000956.html">Here's the Feedburner post</a> on the new chart with a screen shot. The speed increase they mention is real and a huge plus. I'm looking forward to the coming innovations.</p>
