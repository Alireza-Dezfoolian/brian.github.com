<p><a href="http://seems2shel.typepad.com/itseemstome/">Shel Israel</a> and <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/08/16.html#a10893">Robert Scoble</a> have completed their new book on business blogging, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/047174719X/ref=ord_cart_shr/103-7888568-5787808?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;v=glance">Naked Conversations</a>! Congratulations to two terrific guys who have written what looks to be an outstanding book. Congratulations to <a href="http://wroxblog.typepad.com/minatel/2005/08/scoble_and_shel.html">Jim Minatel</a> as well, the Wrox acquisitions editor who has played a big role in making this happen, and was the only one to have child in the middle of the process!<br /> </p>

<p>You can <a href="http://redcouch.typepad.com/weblog/">visit the book blog</a> to find out more and read the chapter drafts. They've done a great job of writing the book in a very open and transparent way, including posting interview transcripts. If my small part survives the editor's pen, you'll find me in <a href="http://redcouch.typepad.com/weblog/2005/05/chapter_5_littl.html">Chapter 5</a>. I've learned a lot about blogging throughout the process and am eager to read the finished product. </p>

<p>The book is already on Amazon and is due out in January. </p>
