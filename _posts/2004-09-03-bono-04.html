<p>I came across Bill O'Reilly interviewing U2's Bono at the Republican Convention and was completely impressed.   Fox has <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,131198,00.html">posted a transcript</a> that is well worth reading. Bono's passion for the AIDS crisis is as inspiring as his political knowledge is impressive. He avoids personal grandstanding and partisan commentary, the simplest route to press coverage, and instead immerses himself in the detail and nuance of the crisis, determined to save lives at any cost. </p>
