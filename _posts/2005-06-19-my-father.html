<p>My father, John Bailey, passed away over three years ago. He was an incredibly unique person, who gave me my love of words and music. His primary passion was poetry and looking at things different than everyone else. You can actually read nearly 100 of his <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/poetry/archives.html">poems here</a>. </p>

<p>As I can't help but miss him on Father's Day, I thought I'd <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2004/05/john_andrew_bai.html">share the eulogy</a> I gave at his funeral.</p>
