<p>» I really miss <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">Kathy Sierra</a>. What an incredible source of ideas, inspiration and good vibes. </p>

<p>» Great piece on Hillary Clinton by <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110010239">Peggy Noonan</a>. &quot;People want a president to be strong but not hard.&quot; If you haven't seen it, the video she references is <a href="http://www.hillaryclinton.com/video/36.aspx">Hilary's latest campaign video</a>, inspired by the <em>Soprano's</em> finale.</p>

<p>» Ben's revelation on watches: &quot;I finally know why that watch company is called <em>Fossil</em> - it's because nobody buys watches anymore!&quot;</p>

<p>» My contribution to really bad medical humor: what do you call the non-invasive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_colonoscopy">virtual colonoscopy</a>? A <em>semi</em>colonoscopy!</p>
<p>» <a href="http://www.answers.com/miscellany">Miscellany</a>: &quot;A collection of various items, parts, or ingredients, especially one composed of diverse literary works.&quot; The title comes from a book I always wanted to write for Ben. For his first 5-6 years, he was a collector of miscellaneous objects like no one I've ever known. Bottle caps, rocks, shells, dinosaurs, matchbox cars, acorns, leaves, magnets, water smoothed glass (o.k. that one was my idea) and assorted pieces of metal. Every corner of his room featured a collection of something. The story was going to be called <em>Bennett B. and the Land of Miscellany</em>.</p>
