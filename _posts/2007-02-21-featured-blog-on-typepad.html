<p><strong>Leave It Behind</strong> was chosen as today's <a href="http://featured.typepad.com/blogs/2007/02/leave_it_behind.html">featured blog on TypePad</a>! Each day, the site highlights a blog to show the many creative uses of TypePad. </p>

<p>It's a true pleasure to be picked as I'm <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/typepad_featured.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=720,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="240" height="160" border="0" alt="Typepad_featured" title="Typepad Featured Blog" src="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/images/typepad_featured.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>approaching my third year with <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">TypePad</a>. I've definitely developed a loyalty for the service, though there are good alternatives that are often cheaper. I don't always agree with their direction and there are periodic issues, but it is a polished, well-done and reliable blogging service. Besides being a great tool, the one thing that sets them apart from anyone else is their customer service. They have some seriously smart and kind people working for them. When I have a question or encounter a bug, I know I'll receive an intelligent, thorough, and friendly response. They are sincere in their desire to resolve any issue and really listen to their customers. </p>

<p>I've experimented with all the major options and at the end of the day, I always come back to TypePad. If you haven't started blogging or are looking for a more powerful option, <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">give TypePad a try</a>. You won't be disappointed.</p>
