<p>Today was a wonderful ending to a great weekend. The weather continued its fantastic streak and Ben and I were able to take advantage of it with a trip to the park, as well as the dirt mounds conveniently located close by. We had a lot of fun climbing, exploring, and disturbing the local fire ant population.</p>

<p>Ben and I also finished another Phyllis Naylor book, watched a baseball special and some of the first Sunday Night Baseball of the season, but that was quickly superceded by another episode of Trading Spaces: Home Free, the latest family pastime.</p>
