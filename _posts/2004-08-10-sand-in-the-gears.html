<p>Tony Woodlief writes a terrific blog called <a href="http://www.tonywoodlief.com/">Sand in the Gears</a>, popular with many people who visit this site. His latest story, <a href="http://www.tonywoodlief.com/archives/001010.html#001010">Field of Dreams</a>, describes a family evening at the local ballpark and the incredible moments-in-time we have with our children. </p>

<p>Two lines that strike a particular cord with me are <i>Thank you, Lord, that I didn't listen to my reasonable side</i> and <i>it's one more break from the person I don't want my boys to become</i>.</p>

<p>I highly recommend his blog, a great example of the power of personal writing.</p>
