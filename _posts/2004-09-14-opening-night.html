<p>Today was Ben's first game of fall baseball and my first experience as a Little League baseball coach. The entire experience was delightfully fun and strange, all at once. On the one hand, things were very familiar. This is Ben's fifth season (not year - there are typically two seasons in a year) of baseball, so all of us are well versed in the uniform, snack, water bottle, equipment and "Go Angels!" rituals. This season, however, everything else is new.</p>

<p>First, our fine town of Flower Mound recently completed a whole new set of baseball fields. Having been to a practice and game at these fields, I feel comfortable saying that minor league baseball players below AA would be envious. They feature huge dugouts, gorgeous fenced fields with lights, and <b>covered</b> bleachers for the parents.</p>

<p>Second, the kids actually pitch to each other, a first in Ben's five seasons. This is not great news for the batters <i>or</i> fielders (due to the inaccurate throwing arms of 9-year olds, the ball is put in play less often than you would hope), but great news for every boy (like Ben) who's ever dreamed of being a pitcher.</p>

<p>Third, Ben has a new, though familiar, head coach, mostly new teammates, and, for the first time, his dad is wearing a bright red Angles jersey.</p>

<p>Now, let me clear up a couple of misconceptions about the word <i>coach</i>. In my case, this does not mean I'm writing lineup cards, arguing with umpires, sending the runner from third on a deep fly, or even typing reminder emails to over-scheduled parents. It means I show up, wear the shirt, and be there for my boy.</p>

<p>I've helped during each season of baseball, but I never quite made it to the level of <i>coach</i>. Being a fairly well-adjusted, all-American community, nearly all of the fathers are involved in some fashion and with as many as 5 or 6 coaches, I often retreated to the bleachers with Lori when game time arrived.</p>

<p>With this year's change in coaches, there was a greater need for help, so when I was asked, I gladly accepted. (Quick note to all those seeking volunteers - a lot of people are just an ask away from serving; a face-to-face request, not a form letter or email.) So, what do I do? I go to the practices and show up 45-minutes before the game. I warm-up the players and try to limit the dugout chaos (we all have our spiritual gifts). I make sure the right kid is in the on-deck circle and tell impatient 9-year old boys to stop banging their aluminum bats on the concrete.</p>

<p>And I play catch with my son in the rain on a Tuesday night.</p>

<p>And I <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2004/09/pitching.html">take a picture</a> when he throws off of the mound for the first time in practice.</p>

<p>And I encourage him to play 2nd base because the throw to 1st is short and the hardest hit balls go in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>And when one of the kids is asked why he's not warming up and responds, "I don't have a coach!" And the head coach says, "Look around you - there's at least six coaches out here." And Ben, overhearing this, runs up to me with bright eyes and a full smile, points at me with his mitt, and says "You're <i>my</i> coach!"</p>

<p>And I'm on the field when he gets a hit in his first at-bat of the fall baseball season.</p>
