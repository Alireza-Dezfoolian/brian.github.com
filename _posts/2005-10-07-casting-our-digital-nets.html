<p>We just launched the <strong>Ed Young podcast</strong> on <a href="http://cp.blogs.com/cp/2005/10/this_weeks_podc.html">CreativePastors.com</a>! Now you can have each weekend's message delivered directly to your iPod. You would not believe how many requests we've had for this - we're thrilled to finally roll it out. Read more about the release and <a href="http://cp.blogs.com/cp/2005/10/this_weeks_podc.html">get the MP3 on the blog</a>. It's an incredible message to start with.</p>
<p>You can subscribe to the podcast in iTunes by clicking the link below. We'll be adding some major podcasting promotion and subscription help to the site shortly.</p>

<p>On a somewhat related note, congratulations to <a href="http://www.evotional.com/">Mark Batterson</a> for his launch of <a href="http://www.godipod.com/">GodiPod.com</a>. Mark is pushing the technology envelope like few pastors I know and, if my sources are correct, actually spent more time with my wife yesterday than I did, since they're both in Atlanta for <a href="http://www.catalystconference.com/">Catalyst</a>!
