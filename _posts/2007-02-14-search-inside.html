Big book news! Amazon has just added the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">Search Inside option to The Blogging Church</a>. You can now view the table of contents, index, back cover, and a lengthy excerpt online.</p>

<p>This is surprising because I heard from the publisher that Amazon had a huge backlog of books waiting to be scanned and that it would be a few months before Search Inside was available. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">Check it out</a>!</p>

<p>While you're there, take a look at some of the latest reviews that have been posted. I greatly appreciate everyone's kind words. My favorite line this week came from Paul Clifford: &quot;There are few books that I'm genuinely sad to finish.&nbsp; This is one.&quot; <em>Thanks, Paul!</em></p>

<p>The book didn't quite break into Amazon's Top 100 last week, but it did make it all the way to&nbsp; #148!</p>
