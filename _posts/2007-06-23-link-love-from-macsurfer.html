<p><a href="http://macsurfer.com/">MacSurfer</a>, the best site to stay on top of Apple news, was kind enough to link to today's post on <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2007/06/the-power-of-co.html">The power of consistent interfaces</a>. I've relied on <a href="http://macsurfer.com/">MacSurfer</a> for years and the consistent quality is truly impressive. I greatly appreciate the link - it's amazing what a high flow site it is, even on a Saturday.</p>
