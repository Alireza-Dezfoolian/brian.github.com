<p>The first meeting of <a href="http://www.refreshdallas.com/">Refresh Dallas</a> was terrific. Brad, Jeph, <a href="http://www.mattmurph.com/myblog/">Matt</a> and I all had a great time. There were over 50 people there and the presentations by two of the <a href="http://www.brightcorner.com">Bright Corner</a> guys were very well done.</p>

<p>I left with a lot of challenging questions about our current redesign project, <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com">FellowshipChurch.com</a>.</p>

<p>For proof that it really happened, you can <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/refreshdallas/">check out the photos</a>. You'll see the four of us featured prominently in one of the first photos. The picture was taken just minutes before we really took the party up a notch!</p>

<p>They are already planning the December meeting, so don't miss the next get together.</p>
