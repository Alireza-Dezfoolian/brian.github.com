<p>I'm happy to announce that we've added a new person to the web team. <a href="http://www.andyknight.com">Andy Knight</a> will be joining us on staff later this month!</p>

<p>As most of you know, <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/10/web_20_and_chur.html">our search began</a> nearly five months ago. Not only is it a challenge to find local, Christian, web professionals who are part of Fellowship Church, but Jeph and Brad have set a very high standard for the level of skills we're looking for. Andy is a great designer with outstanding knowledge of standards and CSS. He's also a good writer who contributes periodically to <a href="http://godbit.com/about/">Godbit</a>. More importantly, he has a passion for Christ and a heart for the local church. He and his wonderful wife, Tiffany, have one son. <a href="http://www.andyknight.com/article/winds-of-change">Read Andy's announcement</a>.</p>

<p>We can't wait to see Andy use his God-given skills at Fellowship! And don't forget, there's <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com/careers#e_763">room for one more</a> if you want to join the team.</p>
