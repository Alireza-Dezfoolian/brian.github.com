<p>Last night, we watched the absolute best vacation movie, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103241/">What About Bob?</a> This is one of my favorite movies of all-time and such a perfect movie to watch on vacation. It is great fun when your children are old enough to enjoy some of your favorite films. Ben thought it was hilarious.</p><blockquote><p>Leo: Please call me Dr. Marvin.</p>

<p>Bob: But at the office, you said I could call you Leo.</p>

<p>Leo: That was at the office. In my home, I'd like you to call me Dr. Marvin.</p></blockquote><p>So many funny moments. What are your favorite vacations movies?</p>
