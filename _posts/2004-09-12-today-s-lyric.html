<p>It's coming to America first,<br />
The cradle of the best and of the worst.<br />
It's here they got the range<br />
And the machinery for change<br />
And it's here they got the spiritual thirst.<br />
It's here the family's broken<br />
And it's here the lonely say<br />
That the heart has got to open<br />
In a fundamental way:<br />
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.</p>

<p>> Leonard Cohen > Democracy > The Future</p>
