<p>InfoWorld's Chad Dickerson has <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/03/22/13OPconnection_1.html">an excellent article</a> on the challenges IT departments face as users begin to request Macs. His initial response to one of his salespeople was &quot;If you promise not to ask for support or help of any kind,&quot; and he's right. If an organization is going to allow exceptions to platform standardization, the user should be a true power user who is willing to do the hard work required to integrate with the existing environment.</p>

<p>Here's <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/dickerson/001225.html">Chad's follow-up</a> after receiving heavy criticism from Apple supporters, despite stating an obvious fact - all technology is merely a means to an end and should be chosen because it is the best solution to a specific problem.</p>
