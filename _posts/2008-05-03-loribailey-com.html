<p>My wife Lori just relaunched her blog, now available at <a href="http://www.loribailey.com">LoriBailey.com</a>. Even better, the new site <a href="http://www.loribailey.com/2008/05/not-because-i-h.html">begins with a post</a> about her fantastic new professional adventure - working with the talented <a href="http://www.lifechurch.tv/">Life Church</a> team to spread the word about <a href="http://open.lifechurch.tv/">open resources</a>.</p>
