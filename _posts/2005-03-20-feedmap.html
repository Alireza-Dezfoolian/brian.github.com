<p>FeedMap is an interesting new way to connect weblogs with real life. <a href="http://www.csthota.com/csthota/">Chandu Thota</a> has written a cool web app that uses MapPoint to display blog locations on a map [via <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/03/20.html#a9690">Scoble</a>]. In other words, you can get a picture of who is blogging in your very own neighborhood. You'll find my experiment on the right-side of <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com">my blog</a>.</p>
