<p>I was born here and I'll die here against my will<br />
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still<br />
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb<br />
I can't even remember what it was <br />
I came here to get away from<br />
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer<br />
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.</p>

<p>> Bob Dylan > Not Dark Yet > Time Out of Mind</p>
