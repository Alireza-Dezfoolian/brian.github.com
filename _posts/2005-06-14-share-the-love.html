<p>The first 24-hours of the Dave Winer <em>Share the Love Summer Tour</em> have been a terrific success! </p>

<p>Thanks to both <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/06/14.html#a10390">Scoble</a> and <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2005/06/14#When:4:57:21PM">Dave himself</a> for linking to my <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/06/thanks_dave.html">original post</a>. Over 30 people have already <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/06/thanks_dave.html#comments">commented</a> and shared interesting stories. It's amazing what a broad impact someone's work can have (thanks especially to <a href="http://betsydevine.weblogger.com/">Betsy</a>, <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Dave</a>, and <a href="http://www.coffeehouse-at-end-of-days.com/archives.html">Russ</a> for adding your perspective). It's been wonderful to see the <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/thanksdave4.jpg">Thanks Dave!</a> badge begin to appear on such a diverse group of blogs. </p>

<p>Now we just need some t-shirts printed before <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com/speakers.phtml">Gnomedex</a> :)</p>

<p>Keep up the great work and tell your friends!</p>
