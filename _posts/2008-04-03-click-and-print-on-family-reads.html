<p>We added a fun, convenient feature on <strong>Family Reads</strong> today. You can <a href="http://www.familyreads.com/2008/04/all-our-reviews.html">grab a PDF</a> that lists all the books we've reviewed so far (each certified as <em>dependably delightful</em>) and print it to take with you on your next library trip. The list is organized by level, so you can focus on the books for your children. Our thanks to Ben for maintaining the list for us.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.familyreads.com/2008/04/all-our-reviews.html">check out the post here</a>. Also, this is great for any friends or family who may prefer print to the web, so feel free to pass it along. Enjoy!</p>
