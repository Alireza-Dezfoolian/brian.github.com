<p>Tonight, President Bush held a primetime press conference, primarily to address the situation in Iraq. I'm disappointed to say how, well, disappointed I was in his performance. Though I support the president's policy in Iraq, his lack of clarify and general defensiveness is not helpful. Not only did he give the impression of being unprepared, he gave a number of terrible answers, particularly when asked if losing the upcoming election would change his conviction on the war. Incredibly, his first response was, "I don't think I'll lose," which he followed with a lengthy speech on why he was going to win in November. Only at the very end did he talk about the soldiers and their families. Here is the answer I was looking for:</p>

<blockquote>If I lose this election, and Iraq is free, I will have served my country with honor. If I lose this election, and America is a safer place, I will have served my country with honor. If I lose this election, and civilizied nations are united in their determination to defeat terrorisim, I will have served my country with honor. 

<p>I was elected President of the United States to serve and defend this country, and that is what I have done. And far greater than my service, is the service of each and every member of our Armed Services, who have given so much of their heart, passion, patriotism, and in far too many cases, their lives, to serve this great nation and free millions from tyranny.</p>

<p>I did not become President to win elections. I became President to preserve and project this country, and that is what I will do until my final day in office, which will be at the people's choosing.</p>

<p>Next question.</blockquote></p>
