<p>» You know how I love clever phrasing. Here's the NYT blurb on Disney's new movie, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/17/arts/television/17musi.html?ex=1345089600&amp;en=1ff0ba1bfdbb2efe&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink">High School Musical 2</a>: 
&quot;The Disney blockbuster that caught on like mono returns with a sequel.&quot;</p>

<p>»&nbsp; Here's an odd coincidence. I have something in common with Mark Driscoll, pastor of <a href="http://www.marshillchurch.org/">Mars Hill in Seattle</a>. He <a href="http://theresurgence.com/md_blog_2007-08-15_good_gifts_this_summer">recently celebrated</a> his 15th wedding anniversary and is approaching the 20th anniversary of his first date with his high school sweetheart and future wife. Lori and I also started dating in high school and celebrated the exact same milestones earlier this year! The similarities end there, though. He has 5 children and has written 2 books with 7 (!) on the way. Me? 1 child, 1 book.</p>
<p>» After we finished watching <em>The Wonder Years</em> together, there was really only one good choice for our next family show... <em>Happy Days</em>! I forgot how much I used to love that show. I must have watched each episode quite a few times, because I've remembered all of them so far. The show has a really nice spirit (at least the early episodes), though there are a few inappropriate insinuations. The lesson of <em>Happy Days</em> seems to be that it's o.k. to mess up - your family and friends will be there for you no matter what. Not bad for a sitcom.</p>
