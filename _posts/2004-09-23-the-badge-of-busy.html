<p>Russ Lipton has written an eloquent post which offers a <a href="http://www.coffeehouse-at-end-of-days.com/2004/09/time_management.html">Christian perspective on time management</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com/FCWeb/AboutFellowship/edyoung.aspx?pgId=266">Our pastor</a> talks regularly about how we love to wear the label <i>busy</i> like a badge of honor. When people ask how we're doing, by far the most common answer is "Busy".</p>

<p>The question is, Busy doing what? What are your priorities? As Ed often points out, a quick review of your day planner and bank statement will tell you where your heart is.</p>

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<i>Maybe our problem is that we aren't allowing God to be the Manager (or CEO) of our time?</i></p>
