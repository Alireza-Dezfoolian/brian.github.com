title: If I could change one thing

<p>If I could change one thing about myself, I would have time for my son when he's going to sleep.</p>

<p>Every evening, I have just a few short hours with Ben. We have dinner and then there are dishes to wash and a lot of things to get ready for the next day. The dinner table conversations vary greatly - sometimes they are focused on work and other times we talk a lot about the school day. As any parent of a double-digit child will tell you, usually it's more like a Q&amp;A than a true conversation. Ben is ready to move on to other things.</p>

<p>Then, a magical thing happens. He takes a shower, reads in bed for a little while, and then I come to tuck him in. At his moment, his mind is full of excitement and racing with ideas. In the shower, he made up two new scenes from his new <em>Star Wars</em> movie and came up with an idea for a video game.</p>

<p>And he wants to tell me about it. <em>All</em> about it!</p>

<p>He even remembers a funny thing that happened at recess and an interesting book he's reading for an upcoming school project.</p>

<p>But all I can think about is the seven things I need/want to do <em>after</em> he goes to sleep. There's more work to do, a book to write, and a lovely wife to spend time with. There's a show on TiVO and a magazine to read. <em>My mind</em> is racing with ideas.</p>

<p>And I miss it. Nearly every time I miss it.</p>

<p>I start to get up. I smother him with rote platitudes and hurry out the door. After all, it's five minutes past his bedtime and I have so much to do. And I think, &quot;Why couldn't he have thought of all these things earlier?&quot;</p>

<p>And he falls to sleep thinking, &quot;Why couldn't he be ready to listen to me now?&quot;</p>

<p>If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?<br /> </p>
