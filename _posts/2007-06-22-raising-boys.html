<p><a href="http://tonywoodlief.com/">Tony Woodlief</a> is a terrific writer and blogger who I've read off and on for years. He writes many excellent posts on fatherhood and raising boys, two things I think about a lot. We crossed paths a couple of years ago when we nearly participated in a book featuring many different bloggers, a project that never saw the light of day.</p>

<p>Last weekend, I was reading my treasured copy of the weekend <em>Wall Street Journal</em> when I came across a piece that sounded vaguely familiar. The theme and writing style struck a chord and I skimmed to the end to see who wrote this interesting article — none other than Tony Woodlief!</p>

<p>Wow — a Father's Day essay in the <em>Wall Street Journal!</em> You can <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/taste/?id=110010215">read it online</a>. Of course, it's excellent and well worth the read. The only thing missing was a quote from one of the best movies of all time, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098258/">Say Anything</a>: &quot;The world is full of guys. Be a man. Don't be a guy.&quot; I'm thinking of having this printed on a t-shirt for Ben.</p>

<p>If you don't already read his blog, <a href="http://tonywoodlief.com/">Sand in the Gears</a>, be sure to check it out. <em>Congratulations, Tony!</em> </p>
