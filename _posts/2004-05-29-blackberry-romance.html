<p>Here's a fun <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/30/fashion/30BLAC.html?ex=1401249600&en=50c6307ef79adda2&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND">New York Times article</a> on the impact of BlackBerries (handheld phone and email gadget) on the Washington D.C. social world. If I ever make it back to D.C., I'll have to be sure to bring one along just to fit in. I see to remember reading that Karl Rove is an obsessive BlackBerry user, as is Donna Brazille. In fact, they're known to have developed an odd-couple friendship through their BlackBerries. </p>

<p>I fully expect BlackBerries to be part of next season's <i>West Wing</i>.</p>
