<p>Here are two great tools to improve your iTunes experience.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.iosart.com/foxytunes/firefox/">FoxyTunes</a></p>

<p>This FireFox plug-in allows you to control your favorite music player (not just iTunes) directly from your browser. This is so cool you won't know what did without it!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tunestracker.com/">TunesTracker</a></p>

<p>TunesTracker is a free email notification service that will let you know whenever music by your favorite artist is added to the iTunes store. You can create up to 50 search phrases and whenever a new track is added, you'll be the first to know.</p>
