<p>Merry Christmas everyone! I hope all of you are having a blessed day with family and friends. Lori, Ben and I shared a wonderful morning together filled with clever, thoughtful presents and enough smiles to overwhelm any digital camera. Of course, now that Ben is 10, we received our first wake-up notice at 6:00 am! Contributing to my reputation as an underground spy, Ben got me a shredder for Christmas.</p>

<p>But just because it's Christmas, there's no reason to ignore technology! You can experience the incredible Fellowship Church Christmas message, <em>Light</em>, from the comfort of your own home. Watch Ed Young on <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com/fcweb/home.aspx">FellowshipChurch.com</a> (click <strong>Watch Now</strong>) or grab the <a href="http://cp.blogs.com/cp/2005/12/light_christmas.html">Christmas Day podcast</a>. This is simply the best Christmas message I have ever heard, and it's my <em>seventh</em> Fellowship Christmas. <em>Enjoy and God bless!</em></p>
