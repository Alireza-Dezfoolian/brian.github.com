<p>In the hundreds of thousands words written about today's launch of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a>, I've seen very few about a fascinating twist - today is also the debut of the Pixar/Disney film <a href="http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/ratatouille/">Ratatouoille</a>. Though the iPhone is clearly dominating the news, both the phone and the movie have received <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/488-iphone-reviews-the-first-batch">terrific reviews</a>. The <a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/2007/06/29/movies/29rata.html?ex=1340769600&amp;en=8e5e08e83c7d6591&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink">New York Times calls Ratatouille</a> &quot;one of the most persuasive portraits of an artist ever committed to film.&quot; and the Wall Street Journal writes, &quot;The film sustains a level of joyous invention that hasn't been seen in family entertainment since <em>The Incredibles</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>When have we seen such an amazing run of success in two wildly different fields? iMac, Mac OS X, iTunes, iPod, Powerbook/MacBook and iPhone. Toy Story, Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, and Cars. </p>

<p>It's a good day to be Steve Jobs.</p>

<p><em>Postscript</em>: By the way, thanks, <a href="http://www.scobleizer.com">Scoble</a>, for making me and every other dad in America seem completely lame! <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/06/28/first-in-line/">Scoble and his son Patrick are first in line</a> at the Apple Store in Palo Alto after camping out for the last 24 hours.</p>
