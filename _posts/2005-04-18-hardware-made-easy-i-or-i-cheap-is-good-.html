<p>As I've been researching and purchasing equipment over the past two weeks, our new developer, Brad, has introduced me to a number of great hardware websites. We've found some incredible prices on these:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bensbargains.net/">Ben's Bargains</a> &gt; excellent for finding the up-to-the-minute best deals on Dell hardware, among other things. We've used this site to save hundreds of dollars on recent Dell orders.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newegg.com/">NewEgg</a> &gt; very good prices and reasonable shipping. We found terrific prices on Crucial memory and high-end hard drives.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pricewatch.com/">Pricewatch</a> &gt; the best pricing data available on technology products.<br /><a href="http://www.slickdeals.net/"><br />Slick Deals</a> &gt; bargains on a wide-variety of products from a huge selection of internet retailers.</p>

<p><em>Warning</em>: Some of these sites can become addictive!</p>
