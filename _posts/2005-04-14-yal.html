<p>Yet Another Linux! A lot of people are raving about the new desktop Linux package <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu: Linux for Human Beings</a>. Read this <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008419.html">praise from Russell Beattie</a>. They will even mail you free CDs that allow you to enjoy Linux from boot without touching your existing system. Device support and simplicity is supposed to be the best of any distro. I haven't had a chance to try it yet, but Ubuntu is definitely causing a lot of excitement.</p>
