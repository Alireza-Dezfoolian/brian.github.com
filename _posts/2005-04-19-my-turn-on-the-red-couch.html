<p>As many of you know, <a href="http://scoble.weblogs.com">Robert Scoble</a> and <a href="http://seems2shel.typepad.com/itseemstome/">Shel Israel</a> are working on a book on business blogging for Wiley, due out in January. The project is currently called <a href="http://redcouch.typepad.com">The Red Couch</a>. </p>

<p>They recently interviewed me via email about this site and what effect weblogs have had on Fellowship Church. They posted the <a href="http://redcouch.typepad.com/weblog/2005/04/interview_brian.html">transcript today</a>. You'll also find my advice for other organizations thinking about utilizing blogs and why a church is being included in a book about business blogging.</p>
