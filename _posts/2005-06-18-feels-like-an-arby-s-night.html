<p>One of my absolute favorite <a href="http://www.seinology.com/scripts/script-172.shtml">Seinfeld episodes</a>:</p>

<p>Elaine: So, where do you want to eat?<br />
Puddy: Feels like an Arby's night.<br />
Elaine: Do you believe in God?<br />Puddy: Yes.<br />Elaine: So, you're pretty religious?<br />
Puddy: I try.<br />Elaine: So, is it a problem that I'm not really religious?<br />Puddy: Not for me.<br />Elaine: Why not?<br />Puddy: I'm not the one going to Hell.</p>

<p>I think what is so funny about this whole episode is that Puddy comes across as the bigger fool. Unlike Elaine, he actually claims to believe in something, but he doesn't want it to mean anything.</p>
