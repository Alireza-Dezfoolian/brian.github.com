<p>Here's something I managed to miss, the photo management and editing tool <a href="http://picasa.com/picasa/?">Picasa</a> is now part of Google and,  suddenly <b>free</b>! This software has received rave reviews over the last year. If you use a PC and wish there was an alternative to Apple's iPhoto, this may be what you're looking for.</p>
