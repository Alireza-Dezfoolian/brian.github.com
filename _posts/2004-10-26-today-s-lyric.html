<p>There's a blood red circle<br />
On the cold dark ground<br />
And the rain is falling down<br />
The church door's thrown open<br />
I can hear the organ's song<br />
But the congregation's gone<br />
My city of ruins<br />
My city of ruins</p>

<p>Now the sweet bells of mercy<br />
Drift through the evening trees<br />
Young men on the corner<br />
Like scattered leaves,<br />
The boarded up windows,<br />
The empty streets<br />
While by brother's down on his knees<br />
My city of ruins<br />
My city of ruins</p>

<p>Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up!<br />
Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up!</p>

<p>Now there's tears on the pillow<br />
Darlin' where we slept<br />
And you took my heart when you left<br />
Without your sweet kiss<br />
My soul is lost, my friend<br />
Tell me how do I begin again?<br />
My city's in ruins<br />
My city's in ruins</p>

<p>Now with these hands<br />
With these hands,<br />
I pray Lord<br />
With these hands<br />
With these hands</p>

<p>I pray for the strength, Lord<br />
With these hands<br />
With these hands</p>

<p>I pray for the faith, Lord<br />
With these hands<br />
With these hands</p>

<p>I pray for the strength, Lord<br />
With these hands<br />
With these hands</p>

<p>I pray for your love, Lord<br />
With these hands<br />
With these hands</p>

<p>I pray for your faith, Lord<br />
With these hands<br />
With these hands</p>

<p>Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up!<br />
Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up!</p>
