<p>1. The best and most important blog post during my break: Dave Winer's <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/05/21/adviceForCampaigns.html">Advice for Campaigns</a>. I wish a campaign would take this seriously and make the process about improving the country and not just electing a person.

</p><blockquote><p>Take the money you raise and instead of spending it all on advertising, spend some of it on stuff that helps people now.</p></blockquote><p>2. Incredible <a href="http://www.marshill.org/teaching/download.php?filename=MDUwNjA3Lm1wMw%3D%3D">2-hour Q&amp;A with Rob Bell</a> of Mars Hill in Michigan (MP3 download). There are some truly powerful, and truly funny, moments.</p>

<p>3. Entertaining <em>New York Times</em> article on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/arts/entertainment-usa-politics-songs.html">how presidential campaigns choose theme songs</a>.

</p>

<p>4. After all the wonderful, wacky web videos of the past few years, there's one that for some reason is still my favorite: <a href="http://www.ifilm.com/video/2681181">The Shining Remixed</a>.</p>
