<p>When Google added the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/static.py?page=features.html">AutoLink feature</a> to the Google Toolbar, the move provoked a great deal of debate. I generally agreed with <a href="http://www.kottke.org/05/03/google-toolbar-autolink">Jason Kottke's perspective</a> on the controversy, namely that there are valid reasons to oppose the move, but much of the reaction missed how common this actually is on the web. Even our beloved pop-up blockers modify the site designer's original intent.</p>

<p>However, it's always interesting to see an intellectual debate through the prism of a real life example. Though unrelated to AutoLink, <a href="http://www.gmail.com">GMail</a> also adds links to email messages, even if the links weren't provided by the sender. We had a funny encounter with this recently while sending out a newsletter to <a href="http://www.creativepastors.com">CreativePastors.com</a> users. The email continued a sentence that referred to a new area of the site, but we accidentally left a space between <em>Creative</em> and <em>Pastors.com</em>. The phrase was not a link, but simply part of a title.</p>

<p>I think you see where this is going.</p>

<p>Sure enough, when we received the newsletter in one of our GMail test accounts, GMail was kind enough to turn that phrase into a link to <a href="http://www.pastors.com">Pastors.com</a>! Though a fantastic site, the home of Rick Warren's messages and resources, we don't make a habit of linking to other ministry resource sites in our newsletters.</p>

<p>As I hinted above, one of our developers caught this small mistake before the newsletter was sent and no harm was done. But it is indeed a strange and eye-opening experience when your content is changed, even <em>improved,</em> by a helpful company when you'd rather they just leave it alone.
