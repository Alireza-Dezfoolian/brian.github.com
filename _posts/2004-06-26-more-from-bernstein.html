<p>Eastgate's Mark Bernstein <a href="http://markbernstein.org/Jun0401.html#note_35617">offers more advice</a> on weblog best practices. I greatly appreciate his appeal for civility and patience in online writing. There is a difference between weblogs, discussion groups and instant messenger, and those differences should remain.</p>
