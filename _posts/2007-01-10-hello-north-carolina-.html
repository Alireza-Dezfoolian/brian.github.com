<p>The next stop on the book journey is North Carolina, where the book actually attended its first college basketball game! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">The Blogging Church</a> landed in the hands of church planter <a href="http://taddgrandstaff.com/">Tadd Grandstaff</a> - <a href="http://taddgrandstaff.blogspot.com/2007/01/blogging-church.html">check out the great picture and review on his blog</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Brian and Terry do a great job of laying out why you should blog, what the purpose of blogging is, how to build a solid blog, podcasting, and everything else you have ever wanted to know about blogging. The book reads really easy and it is set-up so that each chapter is broken into multiple categories which allows you to skim through the chapters and read the sections that resonate with you the most.</blockquote>

<p><em>Thanks, Tadd!</em>
