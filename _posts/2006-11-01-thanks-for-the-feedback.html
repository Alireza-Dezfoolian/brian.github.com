<p>Thanks for all the positive <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2006/10/the_cover.html#comments">comments</a> and emails on the book cover - I really appreciate it! Hopefully people will feel the same way when they come across it in the bookstore.</p>

<p>I've also received a lot of feedback on the <a href="http://brianbailey.backpackit.com/pub/784948">list of blogging pastors and churches</a>. I'm regularly adding more blogs, so you may want to <a href="http://brianbailey.backpackit.com/pub/784948">check it out</a> every so often. And if you've already sent me an email about your blog, thanks for patience! </p>

<p>In other news, here's a terrific post on the latest blogging trend. <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/93-its-the-content-not-the-icons">It's the content, not the icons</a>. <em>Amen!</em></p>
