<p>Here's an <a href="http://www.7nights.com/asterisk/archive/2005/04/page-description-diagrams">interesting post on using Page Description Diagrams</a> instead of Wireframes when presenting web design ideas [via <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/wireframes_vs_page_description_diagrams.php">Signal vs. Noise</a>]. Page Description Diagrams focus on the information architecture by prioritizing the content and describing each piece, briefly, in words. The main thing I see this accomplishing is forcing the customer or client to answer the question: What problem are you trying to solve? by removing the How do you want it to look? question altogether. </p>

<p>Both sites have some great feedback as well.</p>
