title: Why do you only love me after I'm gone?

<p>I know this is a simple fact of life, but I still find it fascinating. Why is it always easier to value something when you don't have it than when you do?</p>

<p>You might imagine I'm about to provide some thought provoking and heartfelt sentiments about a family member or other relationship, but I'm actually referring to companies. You certainly see this with husbands and wives, though, where the threat of a divorce or someone moving out is a wake-up call, a sudden catalyst to work hard to protect and renew what you have. A medical report or a phone call from a distant state can have a similar effect.</p>

<p>For today, though, let's keep it much simpler and just focus on the world of business. At the Bailey home, we recently switched from Time-Warner Cable and TiVO to <a href="http://www22.verizon.com/Content/FiOSTV/">Verizon FiOS TV</a>. The switch was very easy and we've been happy with the change, though nothing will ever compare to the utter ease and friendliness of TiVO.</p>

<p>What's funny is the response of the company we left. Verizon has been blanketing every home in our area at least once a week with ads and offers. They are relentless. And every day as you drive through our neighborhood, you see another Verizon van getting ready to do an install.</p>

<p>As we've watched this happen, I've wondered why Time-Warner would just sit back and watch someone steal all of their business. I've had absolutely no communication from Time-Warner in the last year other than the monthly bill. No service improvements, no special offers or discounts, no rewards for loyalty or a simple thank you. There was not a single reason to stay.</p>

<p>But then I called to cancel. At the point of the phone call, I was already watching one of my fresh, new channels on my new service, but <strong>this is when they decide to put effort into customer retention</strong>. I was offered a monthly rate $15 lower than I've been paying if I commit to staying for one year. Not only is this irrelevant at this point, but it's a little unsettling to see them so eager to save me money now, when they haven't been remotely interested in saving me money for the past two years.</p>

<p>Even more interesting is the fact that I've received 3 more phone calls from them since then! And the whole time I'm thinking, "Why are you investing all of this time and money in a customer who is gone instead of the many more who are about to make the same decision?"</p>

<p>The point isn't Time-Warner, of course, and I hope this doesn't read like a typical customer service rant. The part I'm interested in is what this example means in the larger picture. Every organization has to decide how to balance three things: the pursuit of new people, the retention of current ones, and getting back those who have left. It seems to me that <strong>the best companies focus on the first two</strong>, with the result that fewer people leave and those who who do leave for the right reasons.</p>

<p>Finally, TiVO does a great job of making you glad you're a customer. There is a sense of belonging in their marketing and they regularly roll out new features, benefits, and specials to keep you in the fold. Even so, that isn't always enough. </p>

<p>If you're a current TiVO subscriber, though, it might be worth a phone call. When I told them I was leaving, they asked if I'd like to keep the TiVO on an extra TV - if so, they'd be happy cut the monthly fee in half!</p>
