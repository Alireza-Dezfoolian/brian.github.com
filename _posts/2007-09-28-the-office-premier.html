<p>A new season of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/">The Office</a> started last night. It's easily my favorite show on television (I try not to count <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032608/">Meet the Press</a>) and one of the only ones we never miss. This episode was a little uneven, but the whole hour was worth it for this:</p>

<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> Did this happen on company property?</p>

<p><strong>Michael:</strong> It was on company property, with company property. So, double jeopardy, we're fine.</p>

<p><strong>Ryan:
</strong> I don't think...I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.</p>

<p><strong>Michael:</strong> Oh, I'm sorry. What is, 'we're fine'?</p>

<p>All the best quotes are <a href="http://www.theofficequotes.com/category.php?id=56">available here</a> or you can just <a href="http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/video/episodes.shtml">watch the entire episode online</a>.</p>
