<p>Today, Lori and I celebrate our 13th wedding anniversary! We got married one week after graduating from Michigan State in 1992. We had actually started dating <strong>5 years earlier</strong>, during our junior year of high school! Only God's grace could explain how I ended up with the most wonderful wife and mother in the world - I certainly don't deserve the privilege. I would count myself blessed just to know her, and somehow, I get to spend the rest of my life with her.</p>

<p>You can read Lori's <a href="http://bailey.typepad.com/lori/2005/06/13_going_on_30.html">kind words here</a>, while also discovering that she's easily the best writer in the house!</p>
