<p>Joel Spolsky's latest article, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/NotJustUsability.html">It's Not Just Usability</a>, makes the case that software and websites must aim for a goal far beyond an easy-to-use <i>user</i> interface - a thriving, well-done, and inviting <i>social</i> interface. Projects that master the social interface (such as eBay) can always be improved through better UI design. However, if the social interface is missing, UI tweaks alone are not the answer. </p>
