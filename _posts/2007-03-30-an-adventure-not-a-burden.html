<p>Enough about hate, now it's time to talk about love.</p>

<p>Check out this phenomenal acceptance speech by Bono at the recent NAACP awards [<a href="http://www.completinggodsmission.com/">via Malcolm</a>]. Not only does it put our struggles into perspective amongst the incredible pain and suffering of those around us and far away, but it reminds us love isn't an emotion or a state of mind â€” it's a verb, a call to action.</p>

<p>Here are some excerpts...</p>

<blockquote><p>True religion won't let us fall asleep in the comfort of our freedom.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Love thy neighbor&quot; is not a piece of advice, it's a command.</strong> And that means that in the global village, we're going to have to start loving a whole lot more people.</p>

<p>His truth is marching on.</p>

<p>Where you live should not determine whether you live or whether you die.</p>

<p>God has a special place for the poor. The poor are where God lives. God is in the slums, in the cardboard boxes where the poor play house. God is where the opportunity is lost and lives are shattered. God is with the mother who has infected her child with the virus that will take both their lives. God is in the rubble and the cries we hear during wartime. <strong>God, my friends, is with the poor, and God is with us if we are with them.</strong></p>

<p><strong>This is not a burden, this is an adventure.</strong> Don't let anyone tell you it cannot be done. We can be the generation that ends extreme poverty. </p></blockquote>
