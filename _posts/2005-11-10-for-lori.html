<p>Been running so long<br />
I've nearly lost all track of time<br />
In every direction<br />
I couldn't see the warning signs<br />
I must be losin' it<br />
'Cause my mind plays tricks on me<br />
It looked so easy<br />
But you know looks sometimes deceive</p>

<p>Been running so fast<br />
Right from the starting line<br />
No more connections<br />
I don't need any more advice<br />
One hand's just reaching out<br />
And one's just hangin' on<br />
It seems my weaknesses<br />
Just keep going strong</p>

<p>Head over heels<br />
Where should I go<br />
Can't stop myself<br />
Outta control<br />
Head over heels<br />
No time to think<br />
Looks like<br />
The whole world's out of sync</p>

<p>Been running so hard<br />
When what I need is to unwind<br />
The voice of reason<br />
Is one I left so far behind<br />
I've waited so long<br />
So long to play this part<br />
And just remembered<br />
That I'd forgotten about my heart</p>

<p>Head over heels<br />
Where should I go<br />
Can't stop myself<br />
Outta control<br />
Head over heels<br />
No time to think<br />
Looks like<br />
The whole world's out of sync</p>

<p>> Head Over Heels > The Go-Go's</p>
