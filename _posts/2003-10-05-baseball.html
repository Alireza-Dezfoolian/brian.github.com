<p>This has been a wonderful baseball weekend with Ben. On Saturday morning, he played his best game of baseball ever. For the first time, he was 4 for 4, with 4 singles and 3 runs scored, one all the way from first base. He made a good play at third base for an out, and then, we he was playing second, he was part of a triple play! There was a man (well, boy) on first and second. The batter hit a pop fly toward third. The third baseman caught it and then threw to Ben at second for the second out. Then Ben threw to first for the third out! It was quite a play. After watching baseball all afternoon, then church and shopping, we celebrated his accomplishment with an awesome milkshake at Tin Star.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Ben wasn't able to stay up late enough to see Trot Nixon's extra-inning home run last night to win the game for Boston. But we were able to watch the entire game today and it was definitely one of the best playoff games we've watched. We can't wait for tomorrow's 5th game.</p>
