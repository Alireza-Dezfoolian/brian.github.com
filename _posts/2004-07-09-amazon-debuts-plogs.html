This evening I opened up a web browser and visited Amazon.com and instead of the typical, slightly overwhelming homepage I am normally faced with, I find this, my very own, personal Plog. What is a Plog you ask? Well, that was my first question as well. So far, it is simply a list of recommended products based on past purchases, dated and in reverse chronological order to give it that cool, blog feel. But, perhaps it could soon be more. Here's what Amazon has to say about this beta release.</p>

<p><em>The Plogâ„¢ Service is a personalized blog. Your Amazon.com Plog is a diary of events that will enhance your shopping experience, helping you discover products that have just been released, track changes to your orders, and many other things. Just like a blog, your Plog is sorted in reverse chronological order. When we think we have something interesting or important to tell you, we'll post it to your Plog.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/images/plog_description1.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/images/plog_description1.html','popup','width=826,height=848,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="plog_description" src="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/images/plog_description-thumb.JPG" width="100" height="102" border="0" style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;"/></a></p>

<p>In other words, a personalized blog that a large corporation updates for you without human intervention. Now that's personal! Here's a screenshot of the explanation, which also contains a helpful, though seemingly random, list of blog examples, including only one blog tool company, Six Apart. Perhaps Plogs are built on Movable Type?</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the revolution that is the weblog, the freedom, the democracy, the voice of the people, has finally been achieved. We give you...<b><font color="6699cc">a shopping list</font></b>!<br />
