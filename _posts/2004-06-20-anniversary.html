<p>Today is our 12th wedding anniversary. Since it also happens to be Father's Day, we celebrated yesterday with a great evening of dinner and a movie. We saw <i>The Terminal</i>, which was as good as Roger Ebert said it was.</p>

<p>Not only have Lori and I been married for 12 years, but it has now been 17 years since our first date, which came in our junior year of high school. This means that we have now spent more of our lives as a couple than we have apart!</p>

<p>Anyone who knows us both knows just how blessed I am. Lori is truly a phenomenal woman in every way, talented and creative, joyful and giving, loving and lovely. What a wonderful 12 years it has been.</p>
