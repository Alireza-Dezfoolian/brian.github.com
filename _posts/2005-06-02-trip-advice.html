<p>The week in Florida is over. It was an awesome vacation filled almost exclusively with relaxation! Each day featured walks to the ocean, time in the pool, movies, games, and lots of reading. As I mentioned before, I highly recommend Destin as well as the Hidden Dunes Resort.</p>

<p>If you're planning your next vacation, don't forget to check <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com">TripAdvisor.com</a>. This is an excellent site filled with real reviews of hotels and destinations from real guests. We have used it a lot over the past two years and it has been a great help.</p>
