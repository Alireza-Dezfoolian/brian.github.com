<p>In attempt to avoid the Blue Light Special feel of the blog over the last few days, here are a few other things that are going on in the world...</p>

<li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/08/us/politics/08romney.html?ex=157680000&en=ef3ea027c8a1fdf2&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink">Terrific article</a> on Mitt Romney, former governor of Massachusetts, on his run for president and how he plans to address his Mormon faith.

I love it when newspapers can provide historical context for a piece. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/08/us/politics/08romney.html?ex=157680000&en=ef3ea027c8a1fdf2&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink">Read the full article</a>.</li></p>

<p><li>A sellout crowd of 64,462 saw the <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=213283&amp;cc=5901">United States beat Mexico 2-0</a> in a soccer friendly last night.

In fact, the experience in Houston radically altered how I experience baseball games, which suddenly seemed passionless and monotonous in comparison. Well, at least in Texas. <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=213283&amp;cc=5901">Read the full article</a>.</li></p>
