<p>My son Ben is now in the 5th grade. At the beginning of the year, each student introduces themselves to the class by answering a bunch of questions and bringing in a few items.</p>

<p>Ben was working on his questions the night before and one of them was, "If I had one wish, it would be..."</p>

<p>His answer amazed me. "I don't really need anything."</p>

<p>He is such a happy, contented boy. Even when he desperately wants something (like <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/games/legostarwarsii/">Lego Star Wars 2</a>), Ben always has a great perspective on the important and irreplaceable things.</p>
