<p></h2></p>
<p>On employees as evangelists: "It&rsquo;s almost eerie: Apple employees all like one another, and they have a strong sense that they are the chosen of the earth, and they&rsquo;re not going to be a jerk about it, but all others who dwell on this mortal coil are missing out by not working here."</p>

<p>On Jobs: "Jobs has a great native sense of design and a knack for hiring geniuses, but above all, what he has is a willingness to be a pain in the neck about what matters most to him."</p>

<p>On being obsessive: "One reason Apple makes its own hardware and software is that when Jobs goes to the trouble of creating a piece of software, he doesn&rsquo;t want it running on hardware built by a bunch of dudes he doesn&rsquo;t know and can&rsquo;t fire."</p>

<p>On coming of age: "I was praying to a God I didn't know was listening."</p>

<p>On church communities turning inward: "But it got a little too intense, as it always does; it became a bit of a holy huddle.  If you were going to study the teaching, it demanded a rejection of the world. Even then we understood that you can't escape the world, wherever you go."</p>

<p>Ob belief: "If I could put it simply, I would say that I believe there's a force of love and logic in the world, a force of love and logic behind the universe. And I believe in the poetic genius of a creator who would choose to express such unfathomable power as a child born in "straw poverty"; i.e., the story of Christ makes sense to me. As an artist, I see the poetry of it. It's so brilliant. That this scale of creation, and the unfathomable universe, should describe itself in such vulnerability, as a child. That is mind-blowing to me."</p>

<p>On scripture: "I don't read it as a historical book. I don't read it as, "Well, that's good advice." I let it speak to me in other ways. They call it the <em>rhema</em>. It's a hard word to translate from Greek, but it sort of means it changes in the moment you're in. It seems to do that for me."</p>
