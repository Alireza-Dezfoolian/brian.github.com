<p>I'm blogging the C3 conference on the <a href="http://cp.blogs.com">CreativePastors blog</a> if you want to follow along. Yesterday was <a href="http://cp.blogs.com/cp/2006/01/c3_kickoff.html">the pre-conference day</a> and the first general session kicks off in about 15 minutes.</p>

<p>And the <strong>King of New Media</strong> is in the house! Yes, <a href="http://blog.theaterchurch.com/">Mark Batterson from Theatre Church in DC</a> and <a href="http://godipod.com/">GodiPod.com</a> has brought some of his team to Dallas and will be sharing his experience online. I have a feeling Mark is going to bring a <a href="http://blog.theaterchurch.com/2006/01/c3-update.html">whole new perspective</a> to C3.</p>
