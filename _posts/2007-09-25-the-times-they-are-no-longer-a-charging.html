title: The Times They Are (no longer) A-Charging

<p>In case you missed the news last week, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> has ended its Times Select paid service, meaning that the entire paper is now available online for free! Previously, the editorial page and op-ed columnists were only available through a monthly fee. The company decided that they could generate more traffic (i.e. ad revenue) by unlocking their content and allowing bloggers to drive people to the site.</p>

<p>The best news is that some of the most provocative writers around are now just a click away, including <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/thomaslfriedman/index.html">Thomas Friedman</a>, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/davidbrooks/index.html">David Brook</a>s, and the endlessly interesting and clever <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/maureendowd/index.html">Maureen Dowd</a>. There is speculation that the <a href="http://wsj.com">Wall Street Journal</a>, soon to be part of Rupert Murdock's empire, may eventually take a similar step. If people can't link to your content, and Google can't find it, you definitely risk being left out of the online conversation.</p>
