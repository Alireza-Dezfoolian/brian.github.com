<p>Two year ago, my family came to the conclusion that our meal conversations were dominated by either tales from the workday or ineffective attempts to get my son to discuss school using more than a few words at a time. So, we came up with a solution.</p>

<p>We called it <strong>Table Talk</strong>. Each of us took 10 pieces of paper and wrote a topic we'd like to talk about on each one. Then we mixed them altogether and each night picked a new dinner conversation. The ideas included everything from your favorite color and animal to memories of recess and three things you'd like to learn how to do. The experiment was a huge success as suddenly all of us were sharing ideas and opinions. We even made a version to share with friends at Christmas (with 75 cards <strong>and</strong> 25 blank ones)! I highly recommend starting your own version of Table Talk, especially if you have school-aged children.</p>

<p>Eventually, we started to run out of new ideas and the habit fell out of practice, until tonight.</p>

<p>Ben asked if we could do Table Talk again. In fact, he had a new question for us: <strong>What are three questions you'd like to ask God?</strong></p>

<p>What a great idea. We had so much fun coming up with possibilities: What is Heaven like? What have I spent most of my time doing? I was so impressed by his idea, but then he added one more question for God.</p>

<p><span style="color: #3333ff;"><strong>What is the highest thing I am capable of?</strong></span> </p>

<p>I was completely stunned and speechless. Don't all of us, deep down, want to know exactly that? In that single question is so many of our heart's desires: to achieve, to serve, to pursue the best, to find our purpose, and to be in the center of God's will. I know I'll be thinking about that question every day.</p>

<p><em>I love that boy</em>.</p>
