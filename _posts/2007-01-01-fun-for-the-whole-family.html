<p>One of our New Year traditions is our annual list of family favorites. We started the year Ben was born and have done it every year since, though we took the liberty of answering for him when he was little. Now, he starts asking about it in September, but we still wait until the end of the year.</p>

<p>Basically, it's just a list of each of our favorites over the past year. It's a fun way to look back over the year and usually sparks a lot of conversation. We love putting the lists together, but it's even more fun to look at our answers over the past years and see how much things have changed. Ben's favorite shows have gone from Sesame Street and Blue's Clues to Little Bear and Arthur to Fetch and SpongeBob. And who would have guessed that I liked <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115369/">Spin City</a> so much (in the Michael J. Fox years). On the other hand, Amazon has now been my favorite store for eight years in a row.</p>
