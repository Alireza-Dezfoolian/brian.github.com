<p>Another observation on the iPhone launch. I find it fascinating that everything you want to know about how to use the iPhone is <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">online and in video form</a>. Conventional wisdom says that most people are visual learners, yet most product instructions are heavy on text, with a few simple graphics or screenshots added for good measure. Apple's use of short and long videos (called, brilliantly, <strong>Finger Tips</strong>) to explain features and common tasks is perfectly executed and brings visual help into the mainstream. Want to know how to activate your iPhone? Watch a video. Want to know how to unlock your phone? Watch a video. Remarkably simple, friendly and helpful.</p>
