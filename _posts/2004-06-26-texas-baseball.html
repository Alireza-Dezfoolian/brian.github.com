<p>I can't resist mentioning the fact that the Texas Rangers somehow find themselves in first place nearly half-way into the baseball season, with the third-best record in baseball, after a very impressive <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=240625113">3-1 victory</a> over the Houston Astros tonight. This is the same Texas Rangers who finished in last place the previous four years in a row. </p>

<p>No one here believes it will last, but for now, it sure is nice to have quality baseball to watch on a Friday night with Ben! The Rangers are a young team that is hard-working, fundamentally sound, and fun to watch. Hopefully that will still be true if and when the magic wears off.</p>
