<p>The next time you can't think of a single decent movie to rent or your queue is in desperate need of a refresh, look for a title that could literally change your life: <em><a href="http://www.supersizeme.com/">Super Size Me</a></em>.</p>

<p>This is an unforgettable documentary. <em>Super Size Me</em> tells the tale of fast food in America, primarily <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/">McDonald's</a>. Following a lawsuit brought by two overweight teenagers, which attempted to hold fast food companies responsible for their obesity (later dismissed), the author and director was determined to do something. So, he decided to eat McDonald's three times a day for 30 days in order to measure the physical effects on his body, and make a movie about it. </p>

<p>The film follows him throughout the entire process and the results are staggering. There is also a great deal of information on the current obesity problem we face in America, particularly among students. If your child attends a typical elementary school, y<strong>ou must see this film</strong>.</p>

<p>I told Lori, an avid <a href="http://www.starbucks.com">Starbucks</a> lover, that someones needs to make a movie called <em>Venti Me</em> about life in the Starbucks Nation. She didn't think that was very funny, but then, you know how irritable caffeine can make a person (ha!).</p>
