<p>If you're remotely involved in web development, do not miss <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/">Vitamin</a>. The site launched earlier this month as <em>a resource for web designers, developers, and entrepreneurs</em>. The tagline is <em>nourishment to help the web grow</em>. <a href="http://www.carsonsystems.com/">Carson Systems</a> is developing and driving the site and they've done a great job of getting some incredible people on board - Dave Shea, Shaun Inman, David Hansson, Dan Cederholm, Molly, Eric Meyer and, at times, Jason Fried.</p>

<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/vitaminmasterfeed">One feed</a> brings you articles, news, reviews, and interviews. There are a number of helpful sites out there, but when I first subscribed to this feed, I received almost 30 different posts, and immediately marked 20 of them to read later. <em>Great stuff!</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/">Visit ThinkVitamin.com</a> at least once a day. Medicine never tasted so good!</p>
