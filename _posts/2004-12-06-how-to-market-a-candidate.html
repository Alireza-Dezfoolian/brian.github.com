<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/06/politics/06strategy.html?oref=login"><em>New York Times</em> article</a> [free registration <a href="http://www.bugmenot.com">required</a>] on how the Bush campaign used marketing data on likely voters to target audiences as never before. Once Republicans found data that Democrats are 15% more likely to watch television, they began directing money to new fronts in the ad war, including health clubs.</p>

<p>The article has many pieces of interesting information, including this tidbit:</p><blockquote><p>The channels with the highest proportion of Democrats were Court TV and the Game Show Network; for Republicans, Speedvision and the Golf Channel.</p></blockquote><p>Well worth reading.</p>
