<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/20/technology/circuits/20dona.html">Here's a great article</a> from the New York Times on a fun website I came across a month ago. The site is <a href="http://www.fundrace.org">FundRace.org</a> and with it you can view political contribution information by state, city, and even proximity to yourself, allowing the interested to snoop on their neighbors. You can even search by name and see if the famous back up their words with actions.</p>
