<p>The <a href="http://livingroomcandidate.movingimage.us/index.php">Living Room Candidate</a> is an innovative online museum exhibition presenting more than 250 political television ads from every presidential campaign since 1952. The site also includes a searchable database along with historical background and results of each election. There is also a physical exhibit that happens to be in Dallas at the 6th Floor Museum.
