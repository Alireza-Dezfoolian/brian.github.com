title: Is Odeo the Future of Podcasting?

<p>I stopped by the <a href="http://2005.sxsw.com/interactive/conference/panels/?action=show&amp;id=IAP0094">Future of Podcasting</a> session this afternoon at SXSW. Though the panel had a wide-range of experience and good information, I found the most interesting element was the sight of <a href="http://www.evhead.com/2005/02/how-odeo-happened.asp">Evan Williams</a> relaxing on a couch outside of the room. As a key player in the current podcasting company of-the-moment, <a href="http://odeo.com/">Odeo</a>, I find it equally fascinating that he wasn't interested in being there, and that someone from SXSW didn't make sure he was on the stage.</p>
