<p>Bono spoke this week at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington. You can watch the speech on <a href="http://www.c-span.org/">C-SPAN.org</a> (unfortunately, Real Player is required). It's a truly powerful speech, well worth watching. I've included excerpts below.</p>

<p><a href="rtsp://video.c-span.org/15days/e020206_prayer.rm?mode=compact">Watch Bono</a></p><blockquote><p>[1] God may well be with us in our mansions on the hill. I hope so. He may well be with us in all manner of controversial stuff. Maybe, maybe not. But the one thing, we can all agree - all faiths, all ideologies - is that God is with the vulnerable and the poor. God is in the slums and the cardboard boxes where the poor play house. God is in the silence of a mother who has infected her child with a virus that will end both their lives. God is in the cries heard under the rubble of war. God is in the debris of wasted opportunity and lives. <strong>And God is with us, if we are with them</strong>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[2] This is not about charity in the end, is it? It's about justice, the good news yet to come. Look what happened in southeast Asia, with the tsunami. 150,000 lives lost to Mother Nature. <strong>Well, in Africa, 150,000 lives are lost every month, a tsunami every month, and it's a completely avoidable catastrophe</strong>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[3] A number of years ago, I met a wise man who changed my life, in countless ways, big and small. I was always seeking the Lord's blessing and I'd be saying, &quot;Look, I've got a new song. Would you look after it? I have a family and I'm going on tour, please look after them. I have this crazy idea, could I have a blessing on it?&quot; And this wise man asked me to stop. </p>

<p>He said, &quot;<strong>Stop asking God to bless what you're doing. Get involved in what God is doing, because it's already blessed</strong>.&quot;</p></blockquote>
