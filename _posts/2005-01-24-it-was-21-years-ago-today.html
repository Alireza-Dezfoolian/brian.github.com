<p>Take a few minutes and visit <a href="http://www.kottke.org/05/01/jobs-macintosh-video">Jason Kottke's site</a> for a wonderful piece of history. Kottke has posted links to a newly released video of the original introudction of the Macintosh by Steve Jobs, 21 years ago. Whether you're an Apple fan or not, it is fantastic to witness such a historic moment and be reminded of what a leap forward the Macintosh was at that time and how far we've come since.</p>

<p>It's also the perfect companion video to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596007191/qid=1106626033/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/102-3137039-4580935">Revolution in the Valley</a>, an outstanding new book about the birth of the Macintosh.</p>
