</a>Earlier this week, I had the privilege of sitting down for a <a href="http://readwritetalk.com/2007/09/14/brian-bailey-author-the-blogging-church/">podcast interview</a> with <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/about_sean.php">Sean Ammirati</a> from <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/church_blogging.php">Read/WriteWeb</a>. If you're not familiar with <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/">Read/WriteWeb</a>, they are an incredibly talented group of writers covering web technology through both breaking news and in-depth articles. It is one of my favorite sites and a definitive source for what is happening on the web with over 108K readers.</p>

<p>The site recently spent a week focusing on how non-profits can most effectively use the web and technology. My conversation with Sean for <a href="http://readwritetalk.com/2007/09/14/brian-bailey-author-the-blogging-church/">Read/WriteTalk</a> fit into that theme, as we covered the use of blogs by churches, pastors and other non-profits. Sean is a very interesting guy - I hope to talk with him more in the future.</p>
