title: Change versus more of the same
published: 1

<p>Since I launched Leave It Behind over three years ago, I have been guided by a simple phrase - change versus more of the same. It's never been more true than today.</p>

<p>After seven years serving one of the most amazing churches in the country, I will be starting a whole new adventure in October. </p>

<p>It's been
an incredible time professionally, personally, and spiritually. I've worked with outstanding people on an endless list of challenging projects and learned everything I know about
technology and the web.
I'm so thankful for the chance to have been part of such a creative and dynamic place dedicated to the relentless pursuit of people far from God. My passion for <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com">Fellowship Church</a> is the same today as it was when I attended my first service in 1999. </p>

<p>The idea of working for a web company has always intrigued me, though, and God has opened the door to a phenomenal opportunity.&nbsp; </p>

<p>What's the next step? More on that soon!</p>
