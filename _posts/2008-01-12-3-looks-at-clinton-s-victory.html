<p>Maureen Dowd, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/09/opinion/08dowd.html?_r=1&ref=opinion&oref=slogin">Can Hillary Cry Her Way Back to the White House</a> (the best piece I have read anywhere)</p>

<blockquote>What was moving her so deeply was her recognition that the country was failing to grasp how much it needs her. In a weirdly narcissistic way, she was crying for us. But it was grimly typical of her that what finally made her break down was the prospect of losing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Her argument against Obama now boils down to an argument against idealism, which is probably the lowest and most unlikely point to which any Clinton could sink. The people from Hope are arguing against hope.</blockquote>

<p>Peggy Noonan, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120000928241482363.html?mod=opinion_main_commentaries">Who's Crying Now?</a></p>

<blockquote>Between sobs she is going to try to destroy Mr. Obama. She is going to try to end him. She will pay a price for it--no one likes to see the end of a dream, no one likes a dream killer. But she will pay that price to win, and try to clean up the mess later.</blockquote>

<p>Karl Rove, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119992615845679531.html?mod=opinion_main_commentaries">Why Hillary Won</a></p>

<blockquote>Rather than sharpen and build on this message of contrast and change, Mr. Obama chose soaring rhetoric and inspirational rallies. While his speeches galvanized true believers at his events, his words were neither filling nor sustaining for New Hampshire Democrats concerned about the Clintons and looking for a substantive alternative.</blockquote>
