<p>The family and I leave in the morning for a week in Denver and the Rocky Mountains. This is our first trip to Colorado and we're thrilled to be leaving Texas for mountain cool.</p>

<p>Ben is very excited to see a Colorado Rockies baseball game as well as the many natural wonders ahead of us. But more than anything else, I think he just wants to see both us stop working for awhile.</p>

<p><i>The title comes from a fun Bennett word when he was quite a bit smaller. He would always refer to any outdoor exploration (including sidewalks outside of our house) as a vee-venture instead of adventure</i>.</p>
