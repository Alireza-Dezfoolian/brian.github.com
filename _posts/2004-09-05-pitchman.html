Thankfully, I remembered to bring my camera along to record the moment. </p>

<p>For at least a year, he has been terribly interested in pitching. He loves to read about various grip and pitches (4-seam fastball, slider) and attempt to imitate them. I think the chance to pitch is his favorite part about this season of baseball.</p>

<p>And surprise, surprise, he did a great job! He pitched to five batters and nearly every pitch was close to the plate (accuracy is the primary goal at this age). His coach had kind words for him when he was done and it was clear that he was very proud. </p>

<p>There's a small chance that I was too!</p>
