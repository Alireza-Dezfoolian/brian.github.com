<p>Ben's had his third Little League game of the season today. If there is something more wonderful than sitting next to your wife under crystal blue skies on a Saturday afternoon watching your son play baseball, I haven't found it yet. Ben had a great game and really seemed to have fun. His coaches and teammates were terrific as always. This is his fifth season and each is better than the last. </p>
