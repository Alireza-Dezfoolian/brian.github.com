<p>Daniel Pink (of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446678791/qid=1107225531/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/102-3137039-4580935">Free Agent Nation</a></em> fame) is about to release his next book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1573223085/qid=1107225531/sr=2-2/ref=pd_ka_b_2_2/102-3137039-4580935">A Whole New Mind</a></em>. Wired has a preview article: <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.02/brain.html?pg=2&amp;topic=brain&amp;topic_set=">Revenge of the Right Brain</a>.</p><blockquote><p>We've progressed from a society of farmers to a society of factory workers to a society of knowledge workers. And now we're progressing yet again - to a society of creators and empathizers, pattern recognizers, and meaning makers.</p></blockquote><p>Liberal arts and philosophy majors of the world unite! I look forward to hearing Daniel at <a href="http://2005.sxsw.com/interactive/conference/panels/">SXSW in March</a>.</p>
