<p>The fourth and final day was a short one, with just two morning sessions: <em>Web Design 2010</em> and <em>Flash Video Superhighlights</em>.</p>

<p>The first session featured four very smart web designers attempting to predict the future of design. Unfortunately, the session became focused on specific technologies and tools and a series of Yes/No predictions on their long-term viability. (Quick, XHTML 2.0? Will it be around in 5 years?) I was hoping for a discussion about the latest cutting-edge design approaches and methodologies and where design is headed, rather than which W3C spec will be adopted.</p>

<p>The Flash session was more focused and useful, with good examples of current design and a preview of coming Flash advances. Terry <a href="http://www.terrystorch.com/2005/03/sxsw_flash_vide.html">posted a great overview</a> of the session.</p>

<p>After lunch, we headed back to Dallas. This year's conference was substantially better than 2004: better speakers, more depth, more people, more application, and a better hotel! My two desperate please for next year: please add simple stages so we can actually see the speakers after the third row, and please invest in better microphones/sound in all the rooms.</p>

<p>I took an absolutely pitiful number of pictures, but here are the four that turned out.</p>
