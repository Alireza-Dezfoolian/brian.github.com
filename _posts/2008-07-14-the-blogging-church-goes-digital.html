<p>How cool is this? <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blogging-Church-Brian-Bailey/dp/0787984876?tag2=familyreads-20">The Blogging Church</a> is now available for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI73MA?tag2=familyreads-20">Amazon's Kindle</a>! If you have one of those slick wireless reading machines, you can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blogging-Church-Brian-Bailey/dp/0787984876?tag2=familyreads-20">purchase The Blogging Church</a> for $9.99 and be reading it in about a minute.</p>

<p>It's a fun treat to have a book focused on the digital world available digitally. Almost cool enough for me to justify the $359 cost of the Kindle :)</p>

<p>If you're just tuning in, <em>The Blogging Church</em> is a book I wrote (with <a href="http://twitter.com/terrystorch">Terry Storch</a>) that was published early last year. It made a passionate case for using blogs to share the story of your church or organization with both the committed and the curious and featured a lot of terrific advice from talented bloggers in and out of the church world. One of my favorite authors, <a href="http://sethgodin.com/sg/">Seth Godin</a> wrote some kind words about <em>The Blogging Church</em> on its release: "Brian Bailey makes two things crystal clear in this book: if you've got a church, then you need to spread your story. And if you need to spread your story, blogs are now an essential tool. Time to pay attention!"</p>

<p>If you have a Kindle and happen to buy the book, email me a nice pic of <em>The Blogging Church</em> on the Kindle and I'll be happy to send you an autographed copy of the dead tree version.</p>
