<p>Today was the official start of summer in our house, otherwise known as Ben's last day of school! This is always a fun day, but this one was particularly special as it was his last day of elementary school. Twelve weeks from now he will be a 6th grader in a wonderful middle school just a few hundred feet from his current school and still within walking distance of our house. He's very excited and definitely ready for new challenges (we all are, in fact). </p>

<p>Ben spent his first six school years in the same school, which was a fantastic experience. In fact, he had three of his teachers for the entire time and the relationships he developed are truly special.</p>

<p>The day included an awards ceremony and a final walk through the school for the 5th graders, cheered like conquering heroes - no formality or pretension, just a lot of smiles and congratulations.</p>

<p>Lori and I are blessed with a truly amazing boy. I don't think any parents could have it easier than we do. With Ben rapidly approaching life as a teenager, we can't wait to see what fun, surprises, and, of course, challenges lie ahead.</p>

<p>Our tradition is to see a movie on the last day of school and this year it was <a href="http://www.shrek.com/main.html">Shrek the Third</a>, which was a great time, but my least favorite of the three. We have a few more treats in store over our long weekend together.</p>
