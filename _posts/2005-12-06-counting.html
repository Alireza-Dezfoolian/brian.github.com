<p>I received an invitation recently to test <a href="http://www.measuremap.com/">MeasureMap</a>, the new blog stats tool from <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/">Adaptive Path</a>. The product still has the alpha label, but I have to say I am blown away. Like most similar tools, you start by plugging a simple line of javascript into your page template. MeasureMap tracks visits, comments, links, and posts.</p>

<p>The tool does these things incredibly well, but the experience and the design set it apart. Signup could not be faster or easier. All of the data screens are layed out beautifully and simply. You always know exactly what you're looking at and what it means. The site uses Flash in a couple of key areas to create the most impressive and responsive bar graphs I've ever seen (the images on the <a href="http://www.measuremap.com">homepage</a> give a small hint). Simply put, MeasureMap is a pleasure to use.</p>

<p>I'm not the only one who thinks so. <a href="http://performancing.com/">Performancing</a>, a site packed with helpful blogging tips, recently reviewed six different stat tools and ranked MeasureMap first, ahead of <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>. <a href="http://performancing.com/node/333">Read the full article here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.measuremap.com/">Sign up for a MeasureMap invite</a> and give it a try. I'm sure more invitations will be coming when the product reaches beta.</p>
