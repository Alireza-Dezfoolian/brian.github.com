<p>Amen! This is a huge focus for our organization, so much so that our current series is on bridging the gap between our priorities and our commitments (you can watch or listen <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com/fcweb/servicetimes/weekend_message.aspx?pgId=160">online here</a>). In fact, we built a cool .NET web app to track your time and priorities, called <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com/FCWeb/misc/activitylog/retrospective.aspx?pgId=315">Retrospective</a>. The reality of where we spend our time can be somewhat startling.</p>

<p>Here are the three principles we emphasize as a staff:</p>

<p><span style="color: #3333ff;"><strong>Say No to the Good and Yes to the Great</strong></span></p>

<p>We come across hundreds of good ideas every month - new programs or ministries, new web features or marketing ideas. In order to utilize our time and resources effectively, however, we must say no to many of these in order to say yes to those few, great things that truly line-up with our purpose and will have the broadest possible impact. And because of our intense focus on those few things, we can do them with excellence.</p>

<p><span style="color: #3333ff;"><strong>What are You Subtracting?</strong></span></p>

<p>This follows directly from the first principle. Don't tell me what you're adding, tell me what you're subtracting. As your team or organization grows, you must constantly re-evaluate what you're doing to see if it is still effective and still in-line with your purpose. If it isn't, you need to drop it and move on.</p>

<p>Over the past year, we've subtracted four significant pieces from our main website that were not central to the purpose of the church. Now we can spend more time and resources on the great, instead of the good.</p>

<p><span style="color: #3333cc;"><strong>Only Do What Only You Can Do</strong></span></p>

<p>Every person brings unique talents and passions to their work. Once those talents become clear, systematically work to strip away as much as possible so you can focus all of your creative energy on what only you can do. Develop your strengths, not your weaknesses. You will thrive and so will your organization.</p>
