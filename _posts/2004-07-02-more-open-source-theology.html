<p><a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=7653">The Penguin Driven Church Office</a> is a great article by Pastor Don Parris of a start-up church in North Carolina. He describes why they have decided to use Linux in his church. This was followed by an article on <a href="http://searchenterpriselinux.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid39_gci990899,00.html">SearchEnterpriseLinux.com</a>.</p>

<p>All very interesting stuff. Also of interest is a project Don mentions that I wasn't familiar with, <a href="http://www.infocentral.org/">InfoCentral</a>, an attempt to build an open source church management system. </p>
