<p>Apple's latest television ads are absolutely hilarious. You can <a href="http://www.apple.com/getamac/ads/">watch them all online</a>. You don't have to be an Apple fan to enjoy them, but it doesn't hurt.</p>

<p>Some very smart people came up with these - people who refused to settle for anything easy and typical. These ads take what is in reality complex, technical information about machines and simplify and humanize it so anyone can follow along <em>and be entertained</em>. The visual representation of networking is just fantastic. I bet <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy Sierra</a> loves these.</p>
