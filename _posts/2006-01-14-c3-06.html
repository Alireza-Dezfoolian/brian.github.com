<p>The <a href="http://www.fellowshipconnection.com/c306/index.php">2006 Creative Church Conference</a> is now less than two weeks away! Fellowship Church hosts the conference every year and it is consistently my favorite event. Of course, it's always one of the busiest as well, but that goes hand in hand. There's just something about the combination of <a href="http://www.fellowshipconnection.com/c306/speakers.php">fantastic speakers</a> and sessions, unbelievable music, and thousands of fired-up leaders who are passionate about the local church. This is my sixth C3 and I can't wait! Ed Young, Bill Hybels, T.D. Jakes, and Erwin McManus...wow!</p>

<p>Oh, and the <a href="http://www.fellowshipconnection.com">conference website</a> and registration process is really slick, too :)</p>

<p>I won't be <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/01/o2bc3.html">leading a breakout session</a> this year, but there's going to be a <a href="http://www.fellowshipconnection.com/c306/extras.php">Tech Time</a> on Wednesday the 25th from 6:30 - 8:30 in our cafe. I'm calling it the <strong>Geek Meet &amp; Greet</strong>. It's just an informal, come and go event where you can meet the FC technology and web teams and we can all share knowledge, ideas, and business cards. </p>

<p>And, as Steve would say, one more thing. It seems like the web team is always launching something new at C3. Hopefully, we'll have some neat stuff to share. If you'll be at C3 this year, I hope to see you there.</p>
