<p>I am currently researching .NET e-commerce solutions for a new website we are developing. Each of our websites has utilized a different solution to the ongoing web store quandry. We have implemented a site-in-a-box from an outside vendor, outsourced the development of a full-featured PHP/MySQL store, and have built a rudimentary shopping cart, once in ASP, once in ASP.NET.</p>

<p>For this project, our quickly approaching deadline prohibits us from building a full-featured store from the ground up. On the other hand, our list of requirements are significant enough that a basic shopping cart is insufficient. Additionally, the site itself is already a .NET solution.</p>

<p>Faced with these parameters, we are looking for a .NET e-commerce package that we can purchase and install quickly to get up and running, but also customize in the future to meet our ongoing needs. We are currently considering the following products: <a href="http://www.storefront.net/">StoreFront</a>, <a href="http://www.netstores.com/">NetStores</a>, <a href="http://www.salescart.com/">SalesCart</a>, and <a href="http://www.dotnetcart.com/">.netCART</a>.</p>

<p>Despite extensive searching, we have yet to come across other significant options. At the moment we are focusing our attention on StoreFront, as it appears to be the most full-featured and offers the potential of RMS integration, though it is also the most expensive.</p>

<p>If anyone has experience with these products or knows of some great options that we're missing, please let me know.</p>
