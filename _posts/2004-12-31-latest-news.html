<p><a href="http://inessential.com">Brent Simmons</a> and <a href="http://www.ranchero.com/">Ranchero Software</a> were kind enough to welcome in the new year with <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3008 ">a new beta release of NetNewsWire</a>, the best blog reader on the planet. Rather than simply focus on bug fixes, this version actually incorporates a number of improvements and new features, including elegant <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw2.0b10/enclosureNotDownloaded.png">support</a> <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw2.0b10/downloadsWindow.png">for</a> <a href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw2.0b10/enclosuresPrefs.png">podcasting</a> (i.e. RSS enclosures)! Be sure to read the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/changenotes/netnewswire2.0b10.php">full list of changes</a> and view the screenshots.</p>

<p>This release is an especially happy moment for me as <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2004/09/all_about_me.html">Leave It Behind</a> has been added to the NetNewsWire Site Drawer! The Site Drawer is an extensive list of weblogs included with the app. Thanks for the listing, <a href="http://www.inessential.com">Brent</a> and <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/">Sheila</a>, it's great fun to be included in one of my favorite pieces of software!<br /> </p>
