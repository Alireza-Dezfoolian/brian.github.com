<p>According to my handy online dictionary: <em>a confused mixture</em>.</p>

<p>Here's a hodgepodge of weekend notes and links.</p>

<p>1. John Edwards, Democratic candidate for president, will be appearing on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032608/">Meet the Press</a> tomorrow morning for the full hour.  The is the first of their 2008 <em>Meet the Candidates</em> series. Next to the debates, this is an excellent way to learn about each candidate. If you miss it, the transcript and podcast are available later in the day.</p>

<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-Presidential_Candidates_07.html?s=0&amp;ps=false&amp;a=down">Check out this great chart</a> of all the possible candidates in the WSJ.</p>

<p>2. Short, but very <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/04/washington/04mavericks.html?ex=157680000&amp;en=1182b3a437db90c8&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink">interesting article about two Republican mavericks</a>, John McCain and Chuck Hagel, good friends and Vietnam vets who have come to two very different views on the war.</p>

<p>3. Monday is the official beginning of the marketing campaign for the book. There will be a press release and then the book and the release are going to be sent to nearly 150 media organizations. I have no idea what the response will be, but it sounds impressive!</p>

<p>4. The publisher of the book, Jossey-Bass, has a put together <a href="http://www.josseybass.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0787984876.html">a great page</a> where you can view the Table of Contents, the entire index, and read a sample chapter. <a href="http://www.josseybass.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0787984876.html">Have a look</a>.</p>

<p>5. Six wonderful people have posted reviews of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">The Blogging Church on Amazon</a>. I really appreciate the feedback and kind words! I continue to link to as many of the reviews as possible on the <a href="http://brianbailey.backpackit.com/pub/784928">What People Are Saying page</a>. If you've written a review on your blog, it would help if you'd post your thoughts on Amazon as well. <em>Thanks again!</em></p>

<p>6. Here are the most recent reviews: <a href="http://paulneel.blogspot.com/2007/02/book-3-blogging-church-by-bailey-and.html">Paul Neel</a>, <a href="http://ghostofmediocrity.blogspot.com/2007/02/blogging-church.html">Josh McAlister</a>, <a href="http://jonathaneverette.blogspot.com/2007/02/review-of-blogging-church.html">Jonathan Everette</a>, and <a href="http://jonsampson.blogspot.com/2007/02/review-blogging-church.html">Jon Sampson</a>.  </p>

<p>7. Tonight, the three of us watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082971/">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a> together for the first time. That was easily my favorite movie when I was young and still may be the movie I've seen the most times. I'm amazed at just how good it is - a true classic. The music, acting, relentless storyline, and scenery are all fantastic. It is the quintessential American action movie in my mind, and you can see a lot of what defines America in it. </p>

<p>The disturbing part was when I saw that it was released in 1981. I was eleven years old at the time and remember seeing it in the theatre multiple times. <em>That's the same age as Ben is now!</em></p>

<p>8. <a href="http://www.beemovie.com/main.html">This movie</a> is going to be huge. Really huge.</p>

<p>9. An <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/02/sports/soccer/02reynaqa.html?ex=157680000&amp;en=73d07705346d2926&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink">Interview with one</a> of my favorite soccer players, former U.S. captain Claudio Reyna on his decision to play in America. The <a href="http://www.ussoccer.com/articles/viewArticle.jsp_281666.html">U.S. plays Mexico</a> in a friendly Wednesday night on ESPN2.</p>

<p>10. One year ago: <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2006/02/blog_power.html">Why the titles of your posts matter</a>. Note: Hodgepodge is a very poor example.</p>
