<p>My son Ben has been very busy this summer. His capacity for creativity amazes me. In the course of a week, he'll work on 3 Lego ideas, the prologue to a book, creating 2 computer games, writing a few blog posts, while continuously developing his very own universe called <strong>Weird World</strong>.</p>
<p>One of his obsessions (along with his friends) is the video game <a href="http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/index.html">Super Smash Bros</a>. A new version comes out in December and he already has a countdown on his desktop. The people behind the game are doing a great job building hype for the game by <a href="http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/index.html">releasing information about it</a> every day on a blog. He's been having fun creating lots of things about the game.
