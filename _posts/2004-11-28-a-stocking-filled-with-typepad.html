<p>Six Apart is beginning <a href="http://www.typepad.com/resources/2004/11/avoid_the_malls.html">a holiday promotion</a> featuring the fantastic <a href="http://www.typepad.com">TypePad</a> software that powers this blog. They are smartly appealing to the already convinced to help spread the news about TypePad to others.</p>

<p>TypePad is by far the best blogging software available, for both beginning and advanced users. TypePad is completely stable, intuitive, elegant, and constantly improving. If that isn't enough, the customer service is first-class; attentive, timely, and enthusiastic (they recently promised to double-check to make sure a problem was resolved <em>on Thanksgiving morning</em>).</p>

<p>Share TypePad with the closet writers in your inner circle!</p>
