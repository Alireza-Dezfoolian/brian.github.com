<p>Something is about to give<br />
I can feel it coming<br />
I think I know what it means<br />
I'm not afraid to die<br />
I'm not afraid to live<br />
And when I'm flat on my back<br />
I hope to feel like I did</p>

<p>Who's to say where the wind will take you<br />
Who's to know what it is will break you<br />
I don't know which way the wind will blow<br />
Who's to know when the time has come around<br />
Don't wanna see you cry<br />
I know that this is not goodbye</p>

<p>U2 > Kite > All That You Can't Leave Behind</p>
