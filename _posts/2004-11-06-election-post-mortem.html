<p>First, Karl Rove will make a rare Sunday morning appearance, joining Tim Russert on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032608/">Meet the Press</a> tomorrow (along with Barack Obama, William Safire, and Maureen Down). <em>Not to be missed!</em></p>

<p>Next, Newsweek is publishing a series of behind-the-scenes articles on the campaign. Read about the Bush campaign <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6407226/site/newsweek/">here</a> and the Kerry campaign <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6406877/site/newsweek/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/06/opinion/06brooks.html?ex=1257483600&en=b4613533d9a1bdde&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland">David Brooks</a> in The New York Times, says more clearly today what I attempted to say yesterday.</p>

<p><em>Every election year, we in the commentariat come up with a story line to explain the result, and the story line has to have two features. First, it has to be completely wrong. Second, it has to reassure liberals that they are morally superior to the people who just defeated them.

<br /><br />[...] The same insularity that caused many liberals to lose touch with the rest of the country now causes them to simplify, misunderstand and condescend to the people who voted for Bush. If you want to understand why Democrats keep losing elections, just listen to some coastal and university town liberals talk about how conformist and intolerant people in Red America are. It makes you wonder: why is it that people who are completely closed-minded talk endlessly about how open-minded they are?</em></p>

<p>The whole essay is well worth a read.</p>
