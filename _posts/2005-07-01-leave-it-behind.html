<p>Fifteen months ago today, I started this blog. Since then, I have posted at least once each day, 527 posts in all. Now, the time has come to take a break.</p>

<p>This blog and the resulting relationships and conversations have immensely enriched my life. I never would have imagined when I first began experimenting with blogs in 2000 that they could have such a powerful impact. I never would have imagined when I first pitched the idea of using blogs at Fellowship Church in February 2002 that 3.5 years later we would see the explosion we see today; site blogs, internal blogs, team blogs, and over 20 staff blogs. God has greatly blessed this whole experience and I can't wait to see what lies in the future.</p>

<p>For me personally, however, it is time to hit the pause button and rethink, or as Bono said, &quot;We have to go away and dream it all up again.&quot; </p>

<p>I don't know what the future holds for this site or what form that future will take, but I do know that my heart is being pulled in different directions and I want to free my mind and my time to see where that leads.</p>

<p>As always, my deepest thanks to all of you for reading. It has truly been an honor. God bless!</p>
