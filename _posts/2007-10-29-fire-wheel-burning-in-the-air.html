<p>A couple of weeks ago, <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2007/09/change-versus-m.html">I announced</a> that I had left my position at
<a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com">Fellowship Church</a> for a new adventure, but I've been quiet about the
details. </p>

<p>Until now.
</p>

<p>I have the incredible privilege of joining Josh Williams and
the <a href="http://firewheeldesign.com/">Firewheel Design</a> team. I've known Josh for about 5 years - he's one of
the best and brightest of the web world. In fact, he's leading a
half-day workshop at the <a href="http://www.futureofwebdesign.com/">Future of Web Design</a> in New York next month
and speaking at <a href="http://north08.webdirections.org/">Web Directions North</a> this January in Vancouver. A year ago, he was
kind enough to contribute to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">The Blogging Church</a>. Look for his
excellent piece in the final chapter, <em>The One Thing</em>. </p>

<p>More importantly, Josh is a first-class individual and he's
built a team of the same - top talent who are also top people. I'm
truly humbled to be part of this group of artists â€” illustrators, designers, and developers alike, including Scott Raymond, author of O'Reilly's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ajax-Rails-Scott-Raymond/dp/0596527446/">Ajax on Rails</a>.</p>

<p>Firewheel is the company
behind <a href="http://www.blinksale.com/home">Blinksale</a>, the easiest way to send invoices online, <a href="http://www.iconbuffet.com/">IconBuffet</a>,
a social site for buying and trading fantastic icons, and endless
high-quality work for some great companies. In our offices in beautiful
<a href="http://www.southlaketownsquare.com/">Southlake Town Square</a>, we're feverishly working on some amazing new
stuff. If you want to know what, <a href="http://firewheeldesign.com/">sign up</a> and you'll find out soon.
</p>

<p>I'm so thankful for this opportunity and the amazing things that lie ahead. It's going to be an incredible ride!</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: Today's post is brought to you by the Grateful Dead and the song <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/Gdead/AGDL/estimate.html">Estimated Prophet</a>, which is what plays in my mind every time I think of Firewheel and provided the title.</p>
