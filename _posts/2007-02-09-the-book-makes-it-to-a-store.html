Thanks to <a href="http://rwbooth.com/">Robert Booth</a>, I now have proof that <em>The Blogging Church</em> has landed in a real, physical bookstore! Robert snapped this photo at Border's in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and is the official winner of the recent <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2007/01/contest.html">book contest</a>. A $20 Amazon gift certificate is waiting in his inbox. Robert was kind enough to buy this very copy, so hopefully the nationwide Border's inventory system is now showing a run on the book and is ordering replacement copies by the truckload. <em>Enjoy, Robert!</em></p>
