<p> I recently <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/03/a_few_good_edit.html">wrote about the text editors</a> I am researching and received some great feedback. On the Mac, I am focusing on <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/index.shtml">TextWrangler</a>, <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/">Vim</a>, and <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> (a rising, inexpensive <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml">BBEdit</a> competitor). [Side note: for obsessive text editor fans, here's <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/11/05/text_editors.html?page=1">an O'Reilly article</a> that covers most options.]</p>

<p>I thought I would continue to take advantage of my many smart and helpful readers by discussing another product we're researching: multi-user weblog tools. Currently, most employee blogs are hosted externally by either <a href="http://www.typepad.com">Typepad</a> or <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a>. In the near future, we would like to host blogs on each of our sites, as well as incorporate blogs within an intranet. We'd prefer an open source, Linux-based solution that would allow us to use PostgeSQL on the backend and LDAP integration. Here is <a href="http://incsub.org/blog/?p=266">an article on the major options</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/">Movable Type</a> would seem to be a logical choice given our love for Typepad, but I'm amazed at how rarely I hear from people who love it. <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> has many fans, despite the recent spam controversy. <a href="http://www.s9y.org/">Serendipity</a> looks like an excellent blogging system built in PHP, as does <a href="http://www.textpattern.com/">Textpattern</a>. And <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/">Blogsxom</a> is about to be incorporated into <a href="http://www.apple.com/server/macosx/tiger/">Apple's new server OS</a>.</p>

<p>I'd love to hear your experiences and recommendations.</p>

<p>[Update: <a href="http://www.opensourcecms.com/">OpenSourceCMS</a> is a fantastic site that allows you to try most open source content systems, including blogs, groupware, and portals.]</p>
