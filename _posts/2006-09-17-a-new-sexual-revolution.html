<p>This weekend, Ed Young started a brand-new series called <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com/currentseries">Sexual Revolution</a>. The first message, Stripped, was the best talk on sex I have ever heard. Sex should be <em>divine</em> - we devalue it, ourselves, and our creator when we treat it as nothing more than an appetite beyond our control. Whether you consider yourself a believer or not, take a few minutes to check it out. Besides, how many times do you get to see a bed in church?</p>
