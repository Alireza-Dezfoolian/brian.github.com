<p>Phil Crissman offered some much needed perspective in his <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/02/one_way.html#comments">recent comment</a> on this site, which, as is so often the case, led me to visit his. Phil writes mostly about technology and his interesting writing and cool looking site have led me to subscribe.</p>

<p>The best post I've come across offers a fantastic perspective on the latest industry buzzwords, and how they demean the role of actual human beings: <a href="http://philcrissman.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=29&amp;Itemid=39">Scalable Enterprise Solutions</a>.</p><blockquote><p>People - at least, the ones you want - are &quot;scalable&quot;. They can grow,
they can learn, they change, they innovate. Enterprise? People <em>are</em>
your enterprise. Solutions? I can't think of a problem you can have
that won't ultimately take a person to solve it; not a box or a piece
of software -- both of which will need to be invented, created,
evaluated, and installed by <em>people</em>.</p></blockquote>
