<p><a href="http://www.ensight.org">Jeremy Wright of Ensight</a> recently <a href="http://www.ensight.org/archives/2005/01/10/want-to-participate-in-a-book-project/">posted an open invitation</a> on his site for those that would like to participate in an upcoming book on blogging. Along with quite a few other people, I posted a comment that I would love to be considered.</p>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://www.ensight.org/archives/2005/01/12/book-participant-chosen/">Jeremy announced</a> that I had been chosen!</p>

<p>I could not be more thrilled at the opportunity to participate. The project is currently called <em>100Bloggers: An Introduction &amp; Invitation to Blogging</em> and it is designed to give the reader a taste of the incredible number of unique voices and perspectives that can be found on the web. In addition, by its very structure and formation, the book will demonstrate the connectedness of blogs and hopefully encourage others to join the conversation.</p>

<p><span class="style6"><span class="style6"><span class="style6"><span class="style6"><span class="style6"><span class="style6"><span class="style6">As Jeremy said in his invitation, my responsibility is to write 1,000 words on something I am passionate about and have a unique perspective on. I immediately thought of weblogs and technology in the local church, and apparently this idea appealed to him as well. As they say in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071853/">The Holy Grail</a>, <em>God be praised!</em></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span class="style6"><span class="style6"><span class="style6"><span class="style6"><span class="style6"></span></span></span></span></span>I have had the opportunity to review the current list of bloggers and I couldn't be more impressed. I am truly honored to be part of such a great project.</p>

<p>Thanks again to Jeremy. And thanks as well to the many people who have offered congratulations, especially <a href="http://www.misterorange.com/2005/01/congrats-mr-bailey.html">Evan</a>.</p>
