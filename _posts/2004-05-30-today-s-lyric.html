<p>Tumbling greens a pickup screams<br />
Alone above the square<br />
Sing softly</p>

<p>Above the trees where Billy breathes<br />
We float upon the air<br />
Softly sings sweet songs<br />
Softly sings sweet songs</p>

<p>Silent scenes emotion beams<br />
I'll wake you when we're there<br />
Sing softly</p>

<p>Time it seems and broken dreams<br />
Asleep beside the stair<br />
Softly sings sweet songs<br />
Softly sings sweet songs</p>

<p>> Phish > Billy Breathes > Billy Breathes</p>
