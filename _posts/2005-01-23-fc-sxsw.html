<p><a href="http://www.terrystorch.com">Terry</a> and I are officially attending <a href="http://2005.sxsw.com/interactive/?PHPSESSID=83fca8c266af52f3d600e01697e85c05">South by Southwest Interactive</a> this March in Austin. This will be our second SXSW and we're looking forward to an even better week this year. The 2004 edition was held immediately after the rise and fall of Howard Dean and the rise to prominence of MoveOn.org, so the conference had many moments that were more political rally than technology conference. </p>

<p>This year, the focus seems to have returned to technology, with many more <a href="http://2005.sxsw.com/interactive/conference/panels/">How-To sessions</a> and great speakers such as Zeldman, Bruce Sterling, Malcolm Gladwell and Daniel Pink. And did I mention that the guys behind <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com">Homestar Runner</a> are going to be there? </p>

<p>You can't beat the incredible price, $250 for four days, and in our case, the three-hour drive. How could we say no?</p>

<p>If you'll be in Austin this March, be sure to let us know.</p>
