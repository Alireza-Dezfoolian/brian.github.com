<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-08-01-poll-kerry_x.htm">USA Today polling</a> shows a slight <i>decrease</i> in Kerry's standing in the polls following the Democratic Convention. Newsweek's initial snapshot shows a 4-point bounce for Kerry, the smallest convention increase in Newsweek's history.</p>

<p>These polls were discussed on the Sunday morning programs and in various articles today. It is so interesting to see reporters and analysts going to such great lengths to be polite. The explanations have ranged from how different conventions are these days to a polarized electorate to most American's having already made up their minds. Is it a possibility, even a small one, that the convention and Kerry's speech were not quite the home runs they were made out to be? Is it possible that the voters who tuned into Kerry for the first time were underwhelmed, as <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5568072/site/newsweek/">my review</a> suggested?</p>

<p>The last time a convention failed to change any minds was the 1992 Republican Convention in Houston. I don't recall any excuses being made for the Republicans at the time.</p>
