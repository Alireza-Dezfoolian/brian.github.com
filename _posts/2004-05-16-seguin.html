The primary excuse for sharing this piece of information is showing off two pictures I took of possibly the cutest little girl in the world, Seguin.</p>

For Ben, she has always been the little sister he never had. Each time we visit, the highlight is seeing the two of them together. I have no doubt that Ben would have made a wonderful big brother. Her favorite games to play are chase and hide n' seek, and Ben does both with patience and enthusiasm. <p> <p> <p></p>
