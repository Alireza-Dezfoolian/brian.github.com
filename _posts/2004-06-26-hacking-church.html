<p>Here is an interesting post by Lutheran pastor Eric Evers, <a href="http://xphiles.typepad.com/discipleship/2004/06/hacking_culture.html">Hacking Culture, Modding Tradition, Looking Beneath Skins</a>. He does a very creative job of applying a technology insight to the church world. I found myself thinking a lot about <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com">Fellowship Church</a> as I read, but I'm still processing his ideas. Eric has a lot of interesting things to say on his site, <a href="http://xphiles.typepad.com/">xphiles</a>. <i>Recommended!</i></p>
