<p>Wow! How could I have missed this? There's a brand-new board game for the whole family: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0006IXA62/sr=1-1/qid=1107494773/ref=sr_1_1/102-5380902-5851350?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;n=&amp;s=&amp;v=glance">Politics</a>. </p>

<p>Now, no matter how much I enjoy politics, like most of you, I was a bit skeptical at first, but read the reviews. People really love this game. Even people who aren't political geeks. I hope I don't have to wait until my birthday. [via <a href="http://politicalwire.com/archives/2005/02/03/politics_the_game.html">Political Wire</a>]</p>
