<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">The Blogging Church</a> has made its way to Virginia, the home of one my favorite bloggers, church planter <a href="http://tallywilgis.blogspot.com/2007/01/blogging-church.html">Tally Wilgis</a>. Tally not only posted an incredibly generous review and the requisite photo, but took it to the next level by providing <a href="http://tallywilgis.blogspot.com/2007/01/blogging-church.html">the first video review</a>! Major bonus points for Tally. Here's an excerpt:</p><blockquote><p>Brian and Terry run the gammot on tools and tricks as well as providing great insight in how <strong>not</strong>
to use a blog. One of the benefits to this book is that it takes into
consideration the end users and their varied levels of experience. I
can't say enough about how effective they combine basic information
with stories of application, inspiration and any other 'tion' you can
think of.</p>

<p>The novice will be given enough information to drown them
if they try to absorb it at one sitting. The experienced blogger will
gain a new perspective on just how influential their slice of the
internet experience could be when used properly.</p></blockquote><p>Check out the <a href="http://tallywilgis.blogspot.com/2007/01/blogging-church.html ">full post and video here</a>.</p>

<p>Also, in the process of recording an audio endorsement for the book to be used in a future <a href="http://www.leadnet.org/">Leadership Network</a> promotion, Blogging King <a href="http://www.evotional.com/2007/01/blogging-church.html">Mark Batterson had some nice things to say</a> about <em>The Blogging Church</em>. I can't tell you how much I appreciate this as Mark is a very busy man - he writes more in a year (books, articles, posts, sermons) than most of us read!</p><blockquote><p>Just read my <strong>advance copy</strong> of <em>the blogging church </em>and I loved it. Great combination of <strong>practical </strong>and <strong>inspirational</strong>. Highly recommend it for <strong>beginning bloggers</strong> and <strong>blogging veterans</strong>!</p></blockquote><p><em>Thanks, Mark!</em></p>
