<p>A special blogosphere welcome to <a href="http://www.mattmurph.com/MyBlog/">Matt Murph</a>, former FC web designer and all-around cool guy!</p>

<p>Matt was the primary web designer for nearly two years at Fellowship, designing the current FC site and too many other projects to count, including more header graphics and icons than I'm sure he'd care to remember.</p>

<p>He left our team over a year ago to explore his entrepreneurial side and has remained a big part of Fellowship and a great friend ever since.</p>

<p>If you're looking for <a href="http://www.themurphgroup.com/">a web designer</a>, you can't wrong with Matt. Conveniently, if you're looking for someone to play guitar at your wedding, run your cafe or provide a <a href="http://www.easytithe.com/?r=mg">great solution for your online giving</a>, you also can't go wrong with Matt!</p>
