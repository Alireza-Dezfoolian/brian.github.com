<p>The moment I walked into the office this morning, I knew it was going to be a unique and challenging day. Thursday was both our graphic designer's last day and the last day before Easter and our nine services. There was a huge amount left to accomplish, but we managed to work through it fairly well. We also began laying the groundwork for an immense project that is heading our way, but I can't go into details on that just yet.</p>

<p>On the homefront, it was also Ben's last day before a 4-day weekend. He has a sleep-over Friday night that he is very excited about, and we should be able to enjoy a lot of reading, baseball, and relaxation. </p>
