<p>Check out this great chart put together by Paul Nixon: <a href="http://www.nixlog.com/apple/">Apple's Tipping Point</a>. The chart shows how perfectly the Mac Mini and iPod Shuffle plug into Apple's new mass market strategy. [Added bonus: You can check his <a href="http://www.nixlog.com/apple/sketches.php">concept sketches</a> as well, which are almost as effective.</p>
