title: Framework Upgrade

<p>We upgraded our 2 .NET-based websites to the 1.1 Framework today after a lengthy delay and a great deal of research. I'm sure no one will be surprised to learn that it didn't go as well as hoped, but the conversion is now complete and everything is stable. The most significant thing we missed (and should have remembered from past experience) is the new machine.config file that is created when a new framework is installed. Once we duplicated the previous machine.config, everything fell into place.</p>
