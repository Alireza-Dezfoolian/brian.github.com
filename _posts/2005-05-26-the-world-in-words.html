<p>We listened to two audio books on our twelve hour drive today. Lori does a fantastic job of finding stories that all three of us enjoy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0385498055/qid=1117315616/sr=8-7/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i6_xgl14/102-3137039-4580935?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">The Daydreamer</a> was first. This was a fun, British book on a boy who has so much more going on in his head that you would imagine looking at him. In one chapter, he switches bodies with the family cat for a day, a common topic of discussion in our house. It was a good book to start with, fairly light and short.</p>

<p>We only listened to the first two chapters of our second book, but we are already loving it. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0439531640/qid=1117315668/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-3137039-4580935?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Inkheart</a> is about a man and his daughter, and the mysterious adventure they share. The father is a &quot;Book Doctor&quot;, or binder, who has shared his book obsession with his daughter. There have already been a number of great lines dedicated to their shared love of books, but my favorite so far is this:</p><blockquote><p>Books have to be heavy because the whole world's inside them.</p></blockquote><p>Each of them pack 10-12 books whenever they go on a trip, something I can relate to having just packed and unpacked a vehicle full of them. If you share our unrestrained glee upon returning from the library with armfuls of books, you understand.
