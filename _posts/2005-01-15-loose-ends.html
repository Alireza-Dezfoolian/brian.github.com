<p>Two weekend tweaks, one for you to look at and one for you to do. First, I have a new header for the site, so those of you who only read <strong>Leave It Behind</strong> in a newsreader (highly recommended), take a few seconds to visit the site and check it out!</p>

<p>Second, many of you are subscribed to my original TypePad feed (especially Bloglines users) and not its replacement. </p>

<p>Please update your subscription URL to the new location:</p>

<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/LeaveItBehind">http://feeds.feedburner.com/LeaveItBehind</a></p>

<p>This will be a great help as I will be able to get much more detailed subscription information.<em> Thanks!</em></p>
