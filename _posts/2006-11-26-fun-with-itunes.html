<p>I've found my favorite dashboard widget. Apple's operating system supports these widgets, small programs that can do everything from display stock quotes, a daily cartoon, track flights, and just about anything else (<a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/">view all widgets</a>). My favorite is <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/music/singthatitune.html">Sing that iTune</a>. While a song is playing in iTunes, you can visit dashboard and it will pull up the complete lyrics to the song!</p>

<p>This incredibly handy and I find myself using it constantly. Looking for lyrics online usually entails a Google search followed by a visit to a site that is 95% ads and sometimes contains spyware. The lyrics in the widget are ad-free and very accurate. You can even customize where it pulls the lyrics from if you have a better source. If you have OS X, <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/music/singthatitune.html">give it a try</a>.</p>

<p>My favorite lyric right now is <a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/songs/IWishIWereBlind.html">from Bruce Springsteen</a>:</p>

<p>And though the world is filled <br />
With the grace and beauty of God's hand<br />
Oh I wish I were blind<br />
When I see you with your man</p>

<p>I've been enjoying music a lot since I finally discovered a great use for the MacBook Pro's included <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/frontrow.html">remote control and Front Row</a>. I hook the laptop up to a set of speakers, start iTunes, hop on the treadmill, and control the songs and volume with the super-small, super-slick remote. </p>

<p>iTunes shuffles my playlist for me and in the process, reveals a terrific sense of humor. Out of my thousands of songs, iTunes recently played "Hate & War" by The Clash, followed by "God is Love" by Marvin Gaye. Hate, Love, God, and War in the span of six minutes - wow! </p>
