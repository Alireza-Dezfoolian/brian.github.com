<p>For users of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> music store, Apple is offering speeches from the Republican Convention as free downloads. Apple was kind enough to provide the same service during the Democratic Convention. </p>

<p>Wouldn't it be fun to compare the download rates?</p>
