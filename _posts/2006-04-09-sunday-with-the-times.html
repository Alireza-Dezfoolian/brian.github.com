<p>The New York Times recently redesigned <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">nytimes.com</a> and I absolutely love it. The look is far more elegant and inviting. I find myself wanting to read things that I would have skimmed in the past. The mark of a good design is that you want to spend more time with it. I have to say, though, that if you aren't reading it on a Mac, you would be amazed at just how good it can look.</p>

<p>Today, there are two great articles worth reading. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/09/arts/music/09tomm.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">Condoleezza Rice on Piano</a> is a wonderful story about the Secretary of State's chamber music group that regularly meets and plays in her Watergate apartment. Rice is a classically trained pianist. Her diversity of knowledge and skills is inspiring for someone in public life. </p>

<p>Ben is actually playing Beethoven's <em>For Elise</em> as I write this. He is now in his third year of piano lessons, and though his progress has been amazing, like any 10-year old, it's not his favorite thing. I want to share this story with him so he can see what the ability to make music can be mean in your life.</p>

<p>And yes, I am old enough to remember the famous "Is it live, or is it Memorex?" commercial, which makes this moment even more wonderful.</p>

<p>The second article is a more traditional one, but the type I love: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">McCain Emphasizing His Conservative Bona Fides</a>. There can be no doubt that McCain is running in 2008, which should make things very entertaining. I was an enthusiastic McCain supporter in 2000. </p>

<p>As long as you're reading about McCain and Rice, here's an interesting game to play. What  Democratic ticket would be the best match for a McCain/Rice combination in 2008? I expect both 2006 and 2008 to be heavily Democratic elections, but this pairing presents a number of unique advantages - conservative enough to keep the Republican base enthusiastic, but diverse in thought as well as (obviously) gender and race to attract independent voters.</p>
