<p>The twenty-first review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">The Blogging Church</a> has been posted on Amazon! Thanks to everyone who has taken the time to read the book and post your thoughts about it. I never dreamed the book would have more than 20 reviews a 5-star rating in less than 3 months. I really appreciate all of the feedback, kind words, and helpful criticism.</p>

<p>It's exciting to hear stories of how the book is being put into action by a wide variety of people and churches. In fact, I was recently contacted by a large church that was interested in purchasing copies for their entire staff! </p>

<p>If you or your church has a blogging story, feel free to post it or drop me a note. And if you don't have a copy yet, you can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">pick one up online</a>.</p>
