<p>I followed a morning of meetings, some better than others, with a late morning trip to the airport, followed by a surprisingly long day of travel. With my fellow IT manager with me, we arrived in Chicago a bit late and didn't make it to Willow Creek until 5:30. We were invited to Willow Creek Community Church (WCCC, as it is known here) to bounce unending questions off of their talented IT staff. We met briefly on our arrival, then went to dinner, followed by the hotel and <i>Master & Commander</i>. I'm fairly tired, but definitely looking forward to tomorrow.</p>
