The New York Times has released the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/books/review/10-best-2007.html?ex=1354165200&en=aef091e58fd84632&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink">10 Best Books of 2007</a>, including a equal number of fiction and non-fiction titles. Sadly, I haven't read a single one, though there are three that I have added to my reading list. How about you? Also, what books have you read that should be on the list?
