<p>The <em>New York Times</em> has a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/05/politics/campaign/05rove.html?oref=login">great piece on Karl Rove</a> [registration required]. It not only covers how successful Rove has been over the past decade, but also details his unique role within the administration and the number of innovative tactics he's employed. </p>
