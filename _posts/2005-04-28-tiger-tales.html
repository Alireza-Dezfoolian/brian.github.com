<p>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> (<a href="http://ptech.wsj.com/archive/ptech-20050428.html">Tiger Leaps Out Front</a>) and <em>New York Times</em> (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/28/technology/circuits/28pogue.html?">From Apple, A Tiger to Put in Your Mac</a>) on tomorrow's release of <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Apple's OS X Tiger</a>. Some quotes:</p>

<p><em>&quot;Overall, Tiger is the best and most advanced personal computer operating system on the market, despite a few drawbacks. It leaves Windows XP in the dust.&quot; </em>[WSJ]<em><br /><br />&quot;This [<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/">Spotlight</a>] isn't just a fast Find command. It's an enhancement that's so
deep, convenient and powerful, it threatens to reduce the 20-year-old
Mac/Windows system of nested folders to irrelevance.&quot; </em>[NYT]<em><br /><br />&quot;Tiger is the classiest version of Mac OS
X ever and, by many measures, the most secure, stable and satisfying
consumer operating system prowling the earth.&quot; </em>[NYT]</p>
