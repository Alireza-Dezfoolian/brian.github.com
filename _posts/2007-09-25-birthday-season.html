<p>September is always a crazy time at our house. The start of school is a big event and this year was the biggest of them all - Ben's first year in Middle School! The year is off to an incredible start so far. He loves the variety of classes and greater freedom and responsibility. The school is just a couple of years old, has great teachers, and is within walking distance of our house, so we know just how good we have it!</p>

<p>Just when we're starting to adjust to the new schedule, birthday season arrives - first Ben's, then mine. Ben's party this year was our favorite yet. He had a sleepover with his four best friends and they spent the night having a blast playing Wii games together. He's very selective about his friends, so it was a terrific group of kids. That was followed by a small family celebration on Sunday, where I finally gave him my <a href="http://www.threadless.com/product/921/Video_Games_Ruined_My_Life">favorite Threadless shirt</a>.</p>

<p>And today is my birthday! Thanks to everyone who has sent birthday wishes via email and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/p/Brian_Bailey/526567227">Facebook</a>. It's been a great day, but that's just the beginning. We tend to spread our birthdays out as long as possible, so there are a lot of things just around the corner, starting with <a href="http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/">The Office premier</a> on Thursday.</p>

<p>All of this leads us into what may be my favorite month - October. The weather finally cools off, things slow down a bit, the baseball playoffs start, and we start looking forward to Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. I love fall!</p>

<p>This September has been an especially eventual one, though. Look for more on that soon!</p>
