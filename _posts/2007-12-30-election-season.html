<p>I've written a lot about the presidential race over the past few months. Now, that the Iowa Caucus and New Hampshire Primary are just days away, it's time to take a stand. Over the next couple of days, I'll share a little bit about my political background, my thoughts on the race, choice for president, and predictions. Then, join me on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/bb">twitter</a> Thursday night to follow the Iowa results live.</p>

<p>I have no illusions of my influence, but I think it's a healthy thing for each of us to take a good look at the candidates and choose sides. And I think a lot about the example I set for my son. It's been wonderful to share the campaign with him, and he may have caught a little of the political bug from me, but I don't want him to see politics as a spectator sport to be enjoyed from the sidelines, perpetually unsatisfied and free of risk or responsibility. </p>

<p>More tomorrow!</p>
