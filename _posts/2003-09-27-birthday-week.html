<p>The end of September is always an exciting time in the Bailey household as the birthday season arrives in full force. Sunday the 21st was Ben's 8th birthday as well as his party. Thursday the 25th was my 33rd. And in between fell both of the Grandmother's.</p>

<p>Lori did a great job making Ben's birthday special. He had a backwards party with too many innovative ideas to list. All of the boys loved it, particularly the build-your-own-sundae bar. Of course, it's inconceivable that he is 8 years old and in 2nd grade!</p>

<p>Ben made two of my presents and my card. First was a food-coloring derived 'crystal' and next was a collection of 'cuddle coupons', good anytime! He did such a nice job of putting thought and effort into my presents. Lori got me some terrific U.S. Soccer merchandise as well as some terrific fall clothing.</p>

<p>Now we turn to my favorite month of the year, October. With birthday season behind us, school in full swing, the weather finally changes to fall, baseball playoffs begin, and Halloween approaches. Not to mention that Ben's fall season of baseball continues until the middle of the month. He's doing really well with 2-3 hits each game and great baserunning.</p>
