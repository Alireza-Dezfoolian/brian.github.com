<p>As we begin redesigning our sites, particularly <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com">FellowshipChurch.com</a>, we are constantly looking for ways to make the user experience enjoyable. You would really like to think that users smile while they use your site, but the reality is more often than not confusion and frustration.</p>



<p>I've started to notice that certain sites and pages (including some of our own) do make me smile, though. Here's a simple example from, you guessed it, <a href="http://www.37signals.com">37Signals</a>:</p>

<p><img border="0" class="image-full" alt="Bp" title="Bp" src="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/photos/uncategorized/bp.png" />
<br />
</p>
<p>Now, here's the current login area on our website:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/photos/uncategorized/fclogin.png" title="FCLogin" alt="FC Login" /></p>

<p>Which one makes you smile? Which one makes you want to come back? Which one do you have to squint to read and which one is clear and bright?</p>

<p>We have a lot of work ahead of us, but they always say that the first step is admitting you have a problem!<br />
