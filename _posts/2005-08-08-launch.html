<p>The all-new <a href="http://www.fellowshipconnection.com">Fellowship Connection website</a> is now live! <em>Enjoy</em> all of the CSS goodness! <em>Marvel</em> at the incredible download speeds! <em>Celebrate</em> the cool graphics and bright colors! <em>Experience</em> the one-of-a-kind registration system . . . well, not quite yet.</p>

<p>Yes, we did in fact launch the new site and there is much for you to enjoy. There is only one minor piece missing - registration! We had a very long list of all the pieces that must come together to launch a new site (DNS, SSL, firewall, etc...), but missed one critical element. Our payment processor restricts access to the service by IP address for security purposes. Since this is a brand-new site on a completely different IP scope, our site did not have access to their system.</p>

<p>The great team at <a href="http://www.fellowshiptech.com">Fellowship Technologies</a> has already enabled the service, so by the time most of you read this, all should be well. Just another helpful reminder that there's always <em>something</em> you miss.</p>

<p>Let us know what you think!</p>
