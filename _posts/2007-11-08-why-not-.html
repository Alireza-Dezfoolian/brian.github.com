<blockquote>A two-party debate would at least force candidates of both parties to meet in the same room, listen to one another and speak knowing that weak arguments may be punctured by those on the other side and that voters beyond their partiesâ€™ bases would be watching. It would allow voters not committed to either of the two parties to hear a wider range of views, and it would expose voters committed to one party to the arguments of the opposition. Is anyone out there willing to step forward and sponsor such a debate?</blockquote>
