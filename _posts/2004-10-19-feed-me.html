<p>After this <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000896.php">convincing endorsement</a> by the talented people at 37Signals, I've decided to convert my weblog RSS feed to <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">FeedBurner</a>. For those of you who read <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com">Leave It Behind</a> in your web browser, you can skip the rest of this post.</p>

<p>For those of you who use a <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2004/10/50_is_the_magic.html">newsreader</a>, however, please update your subscription URL to the new location:</p>

<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/LeaveItBehind">http://feeds.feedburner.com/LeaveItBehind</a></p>

<p>You can also access the feed through the <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com">link on the front page</a>.</p>

<p>Why the change? FeedBurner answers the great unanswered questions of weblog syndication: How many people subscribe to my feed? How many times are my feeds read? Which posts are more read than others? </p>

<p>Not only will I enjoy the data FeedBurner provides, but it's an essential experiment if we are to ever syndicate our content through RSS. Organizations that are trained to expect subscription and click-through stats from e-newsletters will expect the same information from syndicated feeds.</p>

<p>After I've accumulated a fair amount of data and experimented more with the tool, I'll share my findings.</p>
