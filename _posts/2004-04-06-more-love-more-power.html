<p>I think everyone in IT would agree that nothing starts a day quite like a prolonged power outage. Something seemingly so simple in the user's eyes...</p>

<blockquote>First, everything was dark, but then the power came on and now there is light! What a relief. Now that the lights are on, I can check my VM, check my email, logon to the website, retrieve my files from the network shares, access the database, check Hotmail, search Google, and stream my favorite radio station. What? We're still down? But, the powers been on for <strong>15 minutes</strong> now!</blockquote>

<p>Enough to make you want to turn around and go back to bed, or at least ask, "Hey, where's the love?"</p>
