<p>You'll read many, many reviews of <a href="http://adisney.go.com/disneypictures/narnia/index.html">The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</a>, but few as perceptive as <a href="http://amylovesbooks.blogspot.com/2005/12/children-witch-wardrobe-and-lion.html">this one by Amy Loves Books</a>.</p>

<p>She does include some heavily generalized mega-church commentary, but that doesn't detract from what is an eloquent perspective.</p>

<p>I'd love to hear from those of you who have seen the movie. What's your take? Also, if your church incorporated the movie into the weekend services, share those stories as well.</p>
