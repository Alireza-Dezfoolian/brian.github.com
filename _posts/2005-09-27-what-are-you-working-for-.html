<p>The <a href="http://www.newsboys.com/">Newsboys</a> led worship at Fellowship a few weeks ago and it was a truly amazing experience. Having never seen them live, I had no idea what they bring to the table. I also had no idea that frontman Peter Fuller preaches as well as he sings.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the new song <em>I am Free</em>, Peter gave a passionate call to true freedom. I haven't been able to get it out of my head.</p>

<p>Freedom is held in His hand<br>
Reach out and touch it today<br>
Freedom in your head<br>
Freedom in your heart<br>
Freedom in your emotions<br>
Freedom in your marriage<br>
Freedom in every area of your life<br>
It's through the blood<br>
It's through the Word<br>
It's through the spiritual family<br>
It's with a purpose<br>

<p>Everyday, I ask myself that question: What am I working for? No matter how many times I hear otherwise, it's so easy to think the burden is on us. That we have to earn our salvation. That we have to earn peace and freedom. That we have to earn God's grace and His blessings for this life. We think that if we just work hard enough, things will work out.</p>

<p>As Christians, we have an incredible opportunity to serve Christ with everything we have and to reach out with love to others in all that we do. But in the end, everything is in His hands.</p>
