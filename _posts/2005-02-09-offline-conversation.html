<p>I had the chance today to have coffee with <a href="http://blog.eriklane.com/">Erik Lane</a>, someone I met through the wonder of weblogs. Erik attends Fellowship Church and when he <a href="http://blog.eriklane.com/archive/2004/10/25/175.aspx">posted about his initial experience</a>, I dropped him a note. We had a few online conversations since then and decided it was finally time to meet in <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com/FCWeb/store/defaultnew.aspx?pgId=287">The Source</a>.</p>

<p>Erik is a great guy, developer (.NET), and one blessed (amazing, homeschooling wife) and busy (four kids) man. Our conversation confirmed once again that blogs really <strong>enable offline conversations</strong> as much as online ones. Meeting someone for the first time who you already know through blogs is very unique as a shared history already exists.</p>

<p>We covered technology, blogs, and the church, along with a few things I hope to write more about soon. <em>Thanks, Erik!</em></p>
