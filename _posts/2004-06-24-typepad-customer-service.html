<p>In the last week, I've opened three separate help tickets within Typepad and have to say, once again, just how prompt, thorough, and helpful the fine folks at Six Apart are to work with. Each issue has been addressed quickly and politely, even in one case where it was user error.</p>

<p>The most recent example was an ongoing speed problem I have had when trying to view my site stats. Within 24 hours, they had deployed a fix and completely resolved the problem.</p>

<p>In the Internet world, few things are as powerful as excellent customer service. Thanks Six Apart (and Brenna in particular)!</p>
