<p>If you do any writing for others to see, you know that it is an endless struggle to improve. <a href="http://www.holtuncensored.com/ten_mistakes.html">Ten Mistakes Writers Don't See</a> is an excellent article by Pat Holt, former editor and critic at The San Francisco Chronicle. The advice is particularly useful if you happen to write fiction, but I think anyone would find helpful information, especially from her great examples [via <a href="http://www.masternewmedia.com/">Robin Good</a>].</p>
