<p>Here's an excellent post from 37signals: <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/272-control-vs-communication">Control vs. Communication</a>.</p>

<p>Whether you build software or use it, this is worth reading. In fact, it applies to organizations in general. The question is: When you face a problem, do you solve it through rules, policies or, in this case, software restrictions, or do you solve it through communication and individual responsibility?</p>

<p>More and more, there's a perspective that software must prevent every mistake a user could possibly make. In fact, if a user can mess something up through a maze of obscure steps, steps nearly intentional in their negative impact, it's a bug in the software, not the person :)</p>

<blockquote>Simply communicating with people about your expectations of their behavior is often the simplest and most effective solution. It&rsquo;s respectful, it&rsquo;s kind, it&rsquo;s fair. And if someone does something you didn&rsquo;t want them to do just remind them politely that they weren&rsquo;t supposed to do that. They&rsquo;ll almost always get it the second time.</blockquote>

<p>The fact is that someone who is attempting to route around authority will continue to seek out those avenues when they hit a manufactured roadblock. That's the core issue to address. Software can do a lot of things, and certainly must handle common mistakes as well as common hacks, but at some point the user has a personal responsibility as well.</p>
