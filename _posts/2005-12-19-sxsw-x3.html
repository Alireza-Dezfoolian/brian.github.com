<p>It's official...I have booked my ticket to the <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/">2006 South by Southwest Interactive Conference</a>. SXSW takes place in Austin each March and this will be my third year in a row to attend. </p>



<p>This year looks like it will be the best year yet. 37signal's <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/bits_n_bytes/pivot/entry.php?id=26">Jason Fried is now a keynote speaker</a>, along with <a href="http://coudal.com/">Jim Coudal</a>, <a href="http://www.craigslist.com/">Craig Newmark</a>, <a href="http://www.kottke.org/">Jason Kottke</a> and <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy Sierra</a>. I believe <a href="http://www.nakedconversations.com">Scoble and Shel</a> will be hosting a panel, along with a ton of <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/">first-class breakout sessions</a>.</p>

<p>As I've said before, SXSW is quickly becoming the best overal web and blogging conference and is an incredible value ($250 for four days). I hope to see many of you there! It appears that the conference is growing in popularity (many of the best hotels are already booked), so don't wait too long to register.</p>

<p>To get a feel for the experience, here are my reports from last year: <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/03/sxsw_day_one.html">Day 1</a>, <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/03/sxsw_day_two.html">Day 2</a>, <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/03/sxsw_day_three.html">Day 3</a>, and <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/03/sxsw_day_four.html">Day 4</a>.</p>
