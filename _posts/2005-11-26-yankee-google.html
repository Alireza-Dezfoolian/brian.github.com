<p>My son Ben has been doing a lot of writing during his week off. He now has a clever collection of Yankee Doodle songs. Here's my current favorite...</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;"><em>Yankee Google</em> by Ben</span></p>

<p>Yankee Google went online<br />Riding on a web search<br />Then he came back with results<br />In 0.4 seconds.

<p>Yankee Google, computing<br />
Finding all results<br />
Yankee Google, computing<br />
And being always trusty.</p>

<p>You can find the <a href="http://bailey.typepad.com/ben/2005/11/yankee_doodle.html">rest of his creations here</a>. Does this mean I'm giving my son <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_juice">Google Juice</a> for Christmas?</p>

<p>He also wrote an incredible poem earlier this month, <a href="http://bailey.typepad.com/ben/2005/11/emc_squared.html">E=MC Squared</a>. I always tell people I'm easily the third best writer in the family.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, Lori posted a list of what each of us is thankful for this year: <a href="http://bailey.typepad.com/lori/2005/11/counting_our_bl.html">Counting Our Blessings</a>. Hope all of you are having a blessed holiday!</p>
