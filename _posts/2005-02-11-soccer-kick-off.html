<p>Earlier this week, Ben had his first soccer practice of the new season. After playing baseball for five consecutive seasons, Ben shocked us by choosing to play soccer this spring. Lori and I were very impressed by his resolute decision to try something new, as we were both the types of kids who would sit in the same seat every day whether there was a seating chart or not.</p>

<p>The practice went very well. The kids were friendly and their years of practice showed. Ben jumped right in, worked hard, and really enjoyed himself.</p>

<p>We celebrated the season's start by watching the U.S. Men's Soccer team start the second round of World Cup Qualifying with a terrific, fast-paced 2-1 victory.</p>

<p>Read what ESPN's <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/feature?id=324565&amp;cc=5901">Marc Connolly</a> and the NYT's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/10/sports/soccer/10soccer.html?ex=1265778000&amp;en=60b16c9a76e567c0&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">Jere Longman</a> had to say about it.</p>
