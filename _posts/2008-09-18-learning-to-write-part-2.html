title: Learning to Write, part 2
published: 1

<p>A few months ago, I started a fun little experiment. I wondered what it would be like to learn how to write code and fiction at the same time. I've dabbled in both over the years, making minimal progress and slowly&nbsp; moving on to things that are, well, easier, at least for me. But its become clear recently that these really are dreams of mine, they are part of who I want to be rather than just skills I want to acquire.</p>

<p>Programming has been part of my life since I was a teenager learning Basic on my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-99">TI-99/4A</a>. In high school, I took a Pascal class, which I loved. In college, I chose a computer science class (C, of course) for one of my electives, partly because it gave me access to a sweet lab of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">NeXT boxes</a>. I enjoyed the class enough to briefly consider extending my education for a couple of years to major in computer science, but decided my philosophy degree was more than enough to launch me into the job market.</p>

<p>The next few years involved more dabbling in this and that, mostly in my free time, until I had the chance to write some .NET code, accessing web services in C#. At the same time, I was starting to learn a lot more about server administration, networking, web servers and databases. I took a Java class as well as some Microsoft courses, which tend to be more about the tools (I probably learned more about Visual Studio than actual programming). </p>

<p>I had the opportunity to continue down the development path, but could not turn down the chance to&nbsp; lead a web team. I loved being able to set the direction, manage people and touch all the different parts of web projects, but it also kept me far from development. Thankfully I was wise enough to move our platform to open source, so I gained a lot of experience with (and appreciation for) PHP, PostgreSQL, Apache, Linux, and the command line.</p>

<p>My son started being curious about programming around this time, which launched me on a obsessive (and ongoing) search for the best way for a beginner to learn how to program. Eventually, I realized that this was maybe a little bit for me as well (hey, some dads make their kids play football). I hope to write a post eventually on what I learned along the way, but the short answer is <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/fr_ltp/learn-to-program">Chris Pine's book</a>. </p>

<p>A year ago, I had the incredible opportunity to join a web startup. The fact that it was a <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> shop made it even more attractive, and I've be able to learn a huge amount about the full Rails stack from my ridiculously talented co-workers. This taste has only made me want to learn more.</p>

<p>I've spent a lot of evenings over the last few months reading some terrific development books, watching <a href="http://peepcode.com/">screencasts</a>, and writing some rudimentary code. Ruby truly is a revelation. You hear the words &quot;joy&quot; and &quot;happiness&quot; used over and over again when people talk about Ruby and Rails, and it's true. Whenever you think, &quot;I don't know how to do this, but it would make sense if it was something like this&quot;, it usually turns out to be true. Compared to most languages, the code is so simple and readable. Most anyone could understand Ruby code and learn to write it with a bit of instruction. It's the perfect language for a beginner and I hope it becomes common in high school computer classes.</p>

<p>I just got back from Denver, where I was privileged to spend 3 days with two of the top Ruby on Rails experts around, Dave Thomas and Chad Fowler. <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/rails/">Pragmatic Studio's Rails class</a> was the best training I have ever had. Just 40 students in a comfortable room, tons of coding opportunities, and entertaining instructors with heavy real world knowledge. Now it's time to put the books down and write.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder why I've never lost my interest in programming. Developers are like the carpenters of old, people who can take a pencil drawing and build something real out of it. I love the problem solving aspect of writing code, along with the power to make ideas happen. And I admit to being intrigued by the art of it as well, the drive to write beautiful code, constantly editing and improving until it is truly creative, elegant and expressive. </p>

<p>A little like fiction, no?</p>
