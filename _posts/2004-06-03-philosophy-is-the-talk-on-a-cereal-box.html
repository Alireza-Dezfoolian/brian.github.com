<p>Here is a funny moment from a recent dinner conversation. I was asking Ben what he wants to be when he grows up and after a long pause he said, "I'll have to think about. After all, I have a few years!"</p>

<p>I was having fun giving him a hard time. "You have to be careful, Ben. After all, you only have 10 years to come up with a plan and that time will fly by. You can't just go wherever the wind blows you or next thing you know, you'll end up..."</p>

<p>Lori interrupted, "With a Philosophy degree!"</p>

<p>As a Philosophy graduate at Michigan State in 1992, I can only say, point taken :)</p>
