<p>What a fun day! Ben and I took the leap and bought tennis rackets this afternoon and just finished spending our first hour playing tennis together. We went to his school, which is about a five minute walk from home, and practiced against the large brick wall that is part of the playground. We both had a great time, so much so that he didn't want to leave even though it was after 9:00 and getting dark. He already asked if we could go again tomorrow night. </p>

<p>And as an additional tennis bonus, here is a <a href="http://www.tennis.com/ProGame/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=72956&itype=1296">very interesting interview</a> with Pete Sampras. Pete was the one tennis player that Lori found interesting enough to watch with me and was a personal favorite. I have to admit, however, that it's a little disconcerting to read about someone my own age retiring from their profession!</p>
