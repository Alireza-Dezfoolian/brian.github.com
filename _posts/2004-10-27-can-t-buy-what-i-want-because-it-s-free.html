title: Can't Buy What I Want Because It's Free

<p><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/10/26.html#a8509">Scoble came across</a> the website of an Apple Store employee in Singapore who is unbelievably passionate about all things Apple:</p>

<p>"<i>I tell potential switchers I really don’t give a damn if they close the sale with me there and then, or if they buy anything from me at all – as long as I know I’ve done my job in sharing the good news, it doesn’t matter if I get the sale: and usually, they come back to me because of that.</i>"</p>

<p>This line had quite an impact on me when I read it. First, how is it that a part-time Apple employee on the other side of the world has a better perspective on the Great Commission than I do? She speaks of going to school, spending 10 hour days on her feet, answering calls and emails late night, <i>anything</i> for her cause, her passion. Do I care as much about my good news as she does about hers?</p>

<p>Second, how often am I more interested in being an evangelist for my favorite products and causes than I am about the Gospel? We talk a lot at Fellowship about fishing stories (i.e. fishers of men), about how each of us should be regularly reaching out to others, inviting them to church, sharing our own life change with those around us. <i>As long as I know I've done my job in sharing the good news, it doesn't matter if I get the sale.</i></p>

<p>Thankfully, I have many fishing stories, and there's nothing more gratifying than the knowledge that by taking that risk, and stepping out in faith, I've made a small difference in the lives of friends and family. I've shared the good news with so many people I know...</p>

<p>The good news about TiVO.<br />
The good news about online DVD rentals.<br />
The good news about Apple.<br />
The good news about weblogs.<br />
The good news about Hondas.<br />
The good news about voting Republican.</p>

<p>My mother is a wonderful Christian and the most fervent Republican you will ever meet. At one point, shamelessly, I asked her, "You have the chance to impact lives for eternity. Why do you spend so much time and energy on who they're going to vote for?"</p>

<p>Who am I kidding? That question was meant for only one person: me.</p>
