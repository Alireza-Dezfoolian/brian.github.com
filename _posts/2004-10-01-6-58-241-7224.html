<p>Today, I celebrate the six month anniversary of <i>Leave It Behind</i>. As the title says, 6 months, 58 comments, 241 posts, and 7,224 hits later, I wanted to commemorate this date and thank each of you who have been a part of this. It is a truly wonderful thing when someone takes the time to read words that you've written. I greatly appreciate the constant feedback, raves, criticism and prodding. This site, my writing, and me, personally, are all the better for it.</p>
