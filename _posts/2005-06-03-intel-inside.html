<p>The news is spreading quickly through the online world: <a href="http://news.com.com/Apple+to+ditch+IBM%2C+switch+to+Intel+chips/2100-1006_3-5731398.html?part=rss&amp;tag=5731398&amp;subj=news">Apple may be switching to Intel</a>. <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/04/0238235&amp;tid=118&amp;tid=3&amp;tid=137">Slashdot</a> has the story and many skeptical comments.</p>

<p>Though the switch has been rumored for years, this is the first time the story has been called <em>official</em>. We'll learn the truth next week, but the rumors should make for an entertaining weekend in the&nbsp; blogosphere!</p>
