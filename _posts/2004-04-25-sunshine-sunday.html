<p>Today was a wonderful day with the family, made even more perfect by the ideal weather. Ben and I were able to spend our first significant time with GarageBand, which was everything we hoped it would be. Within 30 minutes, he had composed his first song, without a minute of reading or training. It was great.</p>

<p>After I took a bike ride, Ben wanted to as well, for the first time in months. We went to the school, did a few laps, and came home for dinner and the Trading Spaces Home Free finale.<br />
