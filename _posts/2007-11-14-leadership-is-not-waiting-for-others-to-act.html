<blockquote>Leadership is not waiting for others to act, or bowing to special interests, or making policy by polling or political calculus, and it’s not hoping that technology will rescue us down the road or forcing our children to foot the bill. Leadership is about facing facts, making hard decisions, and having the independence and courage to do the right thing, even when it’s not easy or popular.</blockquote>
