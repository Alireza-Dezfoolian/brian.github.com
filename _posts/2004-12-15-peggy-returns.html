<p>After taking a <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2004/08/revoteolution.html">three month leave-of-absence</a> from <a href="http://wsj.com"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/archive/">Peggy Noonan</a> has returned to her weekly column. Peggy is head-and-shoulder above nearly every political writer and commentator and is well worth reading whenever possible. Begin with her post-election column, <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110005844">So Much to Savor</a>, and continue through her most recent essay on <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110006000">Hilary Clinton' future</a>.</p>
