<p>The launch of our new online streaming went great this morning and the service is now live!</p>

<p>Visit <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com/fcweb/home.aspx">FellowshipChurch.com</a> and click <strong>Watch Now</strong> on the homepage to check it out.</p>

<p>The site makes an educated guess on your connection speed and defaults you to Good, Better, Best or Audio Only. The best version is over 640 pixels of crystal-clear video goodness. If you have a high-speed DSL or better connection, you'll be amazed.</p>

<p>It's been over two years since we've offered multiple versions or an audio stream, so this should greatly expand the number of people who can access the messages. FYI, Brad <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/code/2005/09/connection_spee.html">posted the connection speed details</a> on our code site.</p>

<p>We're also logging all activity, so we will have very detailed information on where people are watching from, the type of connection, which stream they used, and how long they watched.</p>

<p>The stream is being served by a Linux server running our custom-developed  Flash streaming software. The performance and user experience so far are beyond any hosted service we have tried using Macromedia's <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flashcom/">Flash Communication Server</a>. We have near instantaneous seeking within the stream and almost flawless delivery. The next question will be scalability, which we'll learn more about in the next 72 hours, but we've tested well beyond 200 simultaneous viewers, so we're not expecting issues.</p>

<p>There are more improvements to come. Let me know what you think.</p>
