<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=127624&amp;package_id=139759">dasBlog</a> is a free, open source, ASP.NET blog engine designed to support hundreds of blogs on a single server. A new version has recently been released and <a href="http://davidhayden.com/blog/dave/archive/2005/01/27/804.aspx">developer David Hayden recommends</a> it as the best .NET blog solution. I hope to experiment with it soon as I haven't been impressed by the alternatives.</p>
