<p>Nine years ago today, at 3:33 in the afternoon, an angel from Heaven entered our lives. Ben is a delightful, sweet, and creative boy who is a joy to train and teach, laugh with and play with, and simply be around. Lori and I thank God for him each and every day.</p>

<p>Happy birthday, to my favorite boy in the world!</p>
