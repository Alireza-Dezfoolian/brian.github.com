First thing in the morning, I picked up bagels and Starbucks for a lovely family breakfast. After we ate, Ben and I gave Lori our cards (Ben had made not one, but two, complete with fireworks) and then her presents. She had asked for an apron and so Ben gave her one that I had helped picked out. It was a great idea as they still share quite a bit of kitchen time together. Normally, Lori and I don't exchange gifts on Mother's and Father's Day, but I couldn't resist picking up a book that just came out, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0399151613/qid=1084854815/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/002-7350111-5629607">The Jane Austen Book Club</a></em>. Lori has always loved Jane Austen books and movies and it received rave reviews.</p>

<p>After spending the afternoon reading and helping Ben create a compilation CD for Lori, we went to Macaroni Grill for dinner, another favorite of Ben and his mom. I can't imagine a better mother than Lori!</p>
