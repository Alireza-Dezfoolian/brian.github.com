<p>I love most <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/">Hugh MacLeod cartoons</a>, but this is definitely one of my favorites. What better way to sum up the evolution of the typical blog, something I've been guilty of here as well.</p>
<p>Hugh posted the cartoon as his <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/004480.html">goodbye to Twitter</a>. He deleted his account, believing that his time could be better spent drawing and writing. Less than a week later, <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/004488.html">he's back</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/gapingvoid">twitter.com/gapingvoid</a>): &quot;Too many people I do business with are also on Twitter. Being off it was impossible. My bad.&quot; I'm still working out the balance myself. Nevertheless, thanks for the great cartoon, Hugh!<br /> </p>
