<p>There is a lot of buzz about what <a href="http://www.terrystorch.com">Terry Storch</a> is going to be announcing soon. The man is the king of building up hype - <a href="http://www.terrystorch.com/2005/08/a_peak_into_my_.html">check out this post</a> for evidence.</p>

<p>What amazes me is that not a single person has asked me if I know what he's going to announce! I mean, I've known and worked with Terry for five years now and his office is right next door. You'd think I'd be a likely candidate for bribes or persuasion of some kind.</p>

<p>So, what's the answer? Yes, I know what the announcement is. And yes, it's very cool. In fact, I'll be announcing something soon as well, not that we're competitive or anything.</p>

<p>Check back tomorrow to see what everyone is talking about!</p>
