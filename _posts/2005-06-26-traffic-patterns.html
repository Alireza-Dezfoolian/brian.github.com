<p>I thought it would be interesting to look at the traffic for this site to see if there's a pattern. Sure enough, over the past year, the number of readers and visitors has remained very consistent. Here is the typical order, from highest to lowest.</p>

<p>Tuesday <br />Wednesday<br />Thursday<br />Monday<br />Friday<br />Sunday<br />Saturday</p>

<p>What's funny is that this mirrors the pattern on our websites. I wouldn't be surprised if it's common on the web as a whole. </p>

<p>The takeaway? First, a very high percentage of web traffic is during working hours during the work week. Second, if I have a ground-breaking announcement to make, Saturday is probably not the best day.</p>
