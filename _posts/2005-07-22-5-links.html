<p><strong>1.</strong> Outstanding interview by Tom Peters with Jason Fried from 37Signals [<a href="http://www.tompeters.com/cool_friends/content.php?note=007936.php">Link</a>]</p><blockquote><p>The thing is that we're really big into realizing that there are people
on the other end. We're all using computers to do things, but there are
still people on the other end. It's really inhumane to treat people
with such disrespect when something goes wrong that they get a cryptic
error message that sounds like a computer is talking to them.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Still wonder if the blog conversation can impact your organization? My wife Lori posted about our miserable experience with the local YMCA summer program. Ten days later it's the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=coppell+ymca">6th result on Google</a> when you search for &quot;Coppell YMCA&quot;.

<p><strong>3.</strong> William Strunk on the <em>Elements of Code</em>. Remember, copywriting <u>is</u> interface design. We're working on a new conference registration application and I've probably spent 3 hours over the last month thinking about the title of one particularly challenging section: &quot;Add Previous Attendee&quot;, &quot;Add Existing Staff Member&quot;, &quot;Choose a Staff Member&quot;, &quot;Add Former Participant&quot;, or &quot;Choose from Your Church Roster&quot;. It always seems like simplicity and clarity are just out of reach. [<a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/how_to_write_software.php">Link</a>]</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Don't miss <em>Hotel Rwanda</em>. [<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395169/">Link</a>]</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> <em>The Economist</em> covers the recent good news about student test scores in the U.S., and the political implications for Bush and No Child Left Behind. [<a href="http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=4198655">Link</a>]</p>
