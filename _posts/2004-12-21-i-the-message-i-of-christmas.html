<p>Just in time for the 25th of December, <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000624.php"><em>The Message</em> Bible appears</a> on Kevin Kelly's <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/">Cool Tools</a> site. I bought the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1576834344/qid=1103778471/sr=2-2/ref=pd_ka_b_2_2/102-3137039-4580935">Remix edition</a> after I heard U2's Bono rave about it multiple times. It really is both radically different from other translations and a pleasure to read, whether you're a committed follower or a curious skeptic.</p>
