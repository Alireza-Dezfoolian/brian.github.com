<p>The Weekly Standard provides a great collection of debate analysis:</p>

<p>P.J. O'Rourke's <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/004/770chlec.asp">Putting Words in the President's Mouth</a> offers the President 16 pre-debate talking points. <i>A must read!</i></p>

<p>Hugh Hewitt's <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/004/777tnhfm.asp">A Pretty Good Hand</a> focuses on where Bush stands following the final debate.</p>

<p>Jonathan Last's <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/004/776jwzgp.asp">Return of the King</a> gives excellent, hilarious, round-by-round coverage (worth it for the <i>USA Today</i> references alone). </p>

<p>Fred Barnes's <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/004/778kctvv.asp">On All Cyclinders</a> calls Bush's performance his best as a candidate, likely to assure his re-election.</p>
