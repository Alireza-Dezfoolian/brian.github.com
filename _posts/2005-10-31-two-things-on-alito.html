title: Two things on Alito

<p>President Bush <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/10/31/scotus.bush/index.html">nominated Judge Samuel Alito</a> for the Supreme Court today. I thought Harriet Miers <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/10/first_impressio.html">was a poor choice</a> and was glad that she withdrew her name from consideration. My initial impression is that Bush has selected a great candidate based on his background and judicial philosophy, but it's too early to say much more than that. </p>

<p>The criticism of Alito as too conservative strikes me as odd. First, Bush's 2000 and 2004 campaigns were remarkably consistent on this - he said over and over that he would appoint conservative judges in the mold of Thomas and Scalia. Second, I find it hard to believe that Alito is any more conservative than Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was approved 96-3, is liberal. Elections matter.</p>

<p>Those weren't my two things, though. I noticed two strange items over the past month that I haven't read much about. First, we shouldn't have been surprised by the Miers choice - Bush has a habit of selecting the person he chose to head-up the selection process. If you recall, that's precisely how Dick Cheney became the Vice-Presidential nominee. If I was a potential presidential candidate hoping for his endorsement in 2008, I'd sign-up for the job of vetting Bush's potential successor right now!</p>

<p>Second, when the complaints about Miers began pouring in, there were a number of <em>unnamed White House officials</em> who let it be known that many of the candidates conservatives wanted had declined to be considered. In other words, the best options simply weren't options.</p>

<p>Based on this weekend's list of finalists and the ultimate choice, that appears to have been absolutely false.</p>
