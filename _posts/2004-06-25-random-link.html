<p>Just for fun, the Social Security Administration has a great page on their website where you can sift through decades of <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/">baby name data</a>. You can revisit your year of birth to see how popular your name was, rank names across an entire decade, or see which names were most popular last year. This is a great way to lose 15 fifteen minutes, even if you're not planning on having an child anytime soon. </p>
