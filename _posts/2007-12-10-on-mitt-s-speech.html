<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/opinion/09dowd.html">Maureen Dowd on Mitt Romney's recent speech</a> on religion in America, which includes many terrific lines, but I have to single out these two:</p>

<blockquote>“J.F.K.’s speech was to reassure Americans that he wasn’t a religious fanatic,” Mr. Krakauer agreed. “Mitt’s was to tell evangelical Christians, ‘I’m a religious fanatic just like you.’”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mitt was right when he said that “Americans do not respect believers of convenience.” Now if he would only admit he’s describing himself.</blockquote>

<p>I thought the speech was definitely Romney's best moment of the campaign, but his failure to mention the roll of people who do not believe was disappointing. Overall, I appreciated his thoughtfulness and his approach, but he did not have my support before the speech, and the speech didn't change that.</p>

<p>Here's Peggy Noonan's take: <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110010955">Mormon in America</a>.</p>
