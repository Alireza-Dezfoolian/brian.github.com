<p>Each January, <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com">Fellowship Church</a> and <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com/FCWeb/AboutFellowship/edyoung.aspx?pgId=266">Ed Young</a> host the <a href="http://www.fellowshipconnection.com/FCONWeb/conferences/c3_2005.aspx">Creative Church Conference</a>. Thousands of pastors and church leaders from across the country come to Dallas/Ft. Worth to share ideas on how to model our creative God in everything we do. Every church should be a dynamic, innovative place that reaches the unchurched and builds believers. The conference is one of the highlights of the year for me as I see Fellowship and the role of the local church in a completely new way. This year, Ed will be joined by <a href="http://www.fellowshipconnection.com/FCONWeb/C3/speakers.aspx">Andy Stanley and Rob Bell</a>, two incredible leaders and speakers.</p>

<p>In addition to a number of general sessions, the conference also features a <a href="http://www.fellowshipconnection.com/FCONWeb/C3/preconference.aspx">day of breakout sessions</a>. This year, <a href="http://www.terrystorch.com">Terry Storch</a> and I will be leading a session called, <strong>WWW: Web, Weblogs, and What's Next</strong>. We hope to cover much of what we've learned over the past year on our blogs, address the how and why of weblogs and RSS, and what role the <em>latest and greatest</em> technology (hardware and software) should play in the local church. If you're interested, January is a great time to visit Texas (unless you happen to live in southern California). We hope to have two great Q&amp;A sessions that lead to ongoing conversations.</p>

<p>And through the wonder of weblogs, that conversation can start now!</p>
