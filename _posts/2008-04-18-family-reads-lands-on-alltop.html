You'll find it at <a href="http://books.alltop.com/">books.alltop.com</a>.</p>

<p>What is <a href="http://alltop.com/">Alltop</a>? Alltop is a slick new site from author, serial entrepreneur and certifiably nice guy, <a href="http://www.guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki</a>. The site selects a number of quality blog and news sources on a given topic and gathers all the content on single, lovely looking page. They have a number of topics already and more are being added all the time. We're thrilled to be included in the books category alongside some great sites. </p>

<p>Here's how Guy and his friends <a href="http://alltop.com/about/">describe Alltop</a>:</p><blockquote><p>We help you explore your passions by collecting stories from “all
the top” sites on the web. We’ve grouped these collections —
”aggregations” — into individual Alltop sites based on topics such as
environment, photography, science, celebrity gossip, fashion, gaming,
sports, politics, automobiles, and Macintosh. At each Alltop site, we
display the latest five stories from thirty or more sites on a single
page — we call this “single-page aggregation.” You can think of an Alltop site as a “dashboard,” “table of contents,” or even a “digital magazine rack” of the Internet.</p></blockquote><p>My favorite topics so far are <a href="http://startups.alltop.com/">startups</a>, <a href="http://venturecapital.alltop.com/">venture capital</a>, <a href="http://politics.alltop.com/">politics</a>, <a href="http://twitter.alltop.com/">twitter</a>, <a href="http://mac.alltop.com/">mac</a>, <a href="http://gaming.alltop.com/">gaming</a>, and of course, <a href="http://books.alltop.com/">books</a>. No matter what your interest, Alltop is a great way to stay on top of a topic, while being introduced to new sites and people. Definitely <a href="http://alltop.com/">worth checking out</a>.<br /> </p>

<p>You may remember that Guy was also kind enough to contribute a piece to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">The Blogging Church</a>. I told him that I now owe him two favors (three if he starts playing <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/packrat">PackRat</a>). I have a feeling my favors will somehow involve hockey.</p>
