<p>Easter at Fellowship Church this year featured 18 services over 3 days at 4 campuses, including the brand-new Alliance Campus!</p>

<p>The service was phenomenal and God's hand was present everywhere as thousands of volunteers came together to pull it off.</p>

<p>You can enjoy the incredible message by Pastor Ed Young online and be one of the first to experience our new Flash streaming. Visit <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com">FellowshipChurch.com</a> and click on the <strong>Video</strong> link underneath the message graphic, <strong>Thread</strong>. </p>

<p>The stream is quite a bit larger and of higher quality than we've previoulsy attempted, so we'd love to hear feedback on any delays or other issues you experience. Hopefully you'll be as blown away by the image as we've been.</p>

<p>Have a great Easter!</p>
