<p>Months ago, I came across of great tip on how to make the Windows Explorer folder view your default view when you click My Computer. Of course, this was pre-weblog so I failed to record this information anywhere. My computer was recently rebuilt, so I lost this functionality and was forced to spend a great deal of time searching for the solution was again. At last, here it is, for Windows XP!</p>

<p>1. Double-click My Computer<br />
2. Click Tools > Folder Options > File Types<br />
3. Select the File Type labeled Folder<br />
4. Click Advanced<br />
5. Under Actions, select Explore and click Set as Default</p>

<p>From now on, when you double-click My Computer, you will start in the Explorer view.<br />
