I've enjoyed looking back at 2011 this weekend. What an interesting year, filled with treasured moments, like seeing U2 with my son, and surprising events, like having your [company acquired by Facebook](/2011/12/05/whats-next/). I have a feeling I'll be thinking a lot about what I've learned over the weeks ahead.

For now, let's start with something simple—a quick look at some of my favorite things of 2011.

**Concerts**

Thanks to the amazing city of Austin, this was the best year of concerts I've ever experienced. My list this year includes Mumford & Sons, Yeasayer, Two Door Cinema Club, Diplo, Matt & Kim, Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Widespread Panic, Lucinda Williams, U2, Coldplay, Arcade Fire, Gomez, and Wilco. It's nearly impossible to pick favorites, but if my arm was sufficiently twisted, I would go with Arcade Fire, U2, and Wilco. [Ben](http://benbailey.me) and I are counting down to Radiohead in March.

Also, [ACL Live at the Moody Theater](http://acl-live.com/venue) is my favorite concert venue ever. Beautiful space, fantastic sound, and a casual, friendly atmosphere. 

I'm eagerly looking forward to your year-end lists over the next few weeks.
