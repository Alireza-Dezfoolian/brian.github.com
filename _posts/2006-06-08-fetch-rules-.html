<p>PBS has launched a brand-new kids show, <a href="http://pbskids.org/fetch/">Fetch! with Ruff Ruffman</a>. This is just the second week and only seven shows have aired so far.</p>

<p>Fetch has to be the best television show I have ever seen for kids. Ben is 10 and he loves it. Lori and I are a few years older than 10 and we love it, too. In fact, I would consider it a family show more than a kids show. I think any child over seven would enjoy it.</p>

<p>Here's the basic idea. Fetch is a cartoon dog who has his own game show. The season consists of 20 episodes with the same six kids competing for points. Fetch sends the kids on different challenges that they have to complete to earn points. The challenges so far have included such things as preparing food for animals in a zoo, learning hip-hop dance moves, filming a commercial for the show with real cats, and working in a diner.</p>

<p>The show is fast-paced, very funny, intelligent, incredibly creative, and educational. The kids are smart, normal, well-adjusted Bostonians.</p>

<p>TiVO a couple of episodes and see if you fall in love with <a href="http://pbskids.org/fetch/">Fetch</a>!</p>
