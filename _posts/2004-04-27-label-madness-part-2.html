<p>Continuing yesterday's theme, here is a second profile to ponder:</p>

<p>I live in Texas<br />
I work at a church<br />
My favorite newspaper is the <em>Wall Street Journal</em><br />
I attend church at least 3 times each month<br />
I have never smoked anything, legal or illegal<br />
My favorite author as a teenager was William F. Buckley, Jr.<br />
I have never dyed or pierced any part of my body</p>

<p>Liberal or conservative?</p>
