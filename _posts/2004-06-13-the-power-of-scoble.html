<p>It's been almost a week since Scoble first wrote about Fellowship Church and linked to my site. Previously, a Google search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&c2coff=1&q=brian+bailey">Brian Bailey</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&c2coff=1&q=leave+it+behind">Leave it Behind</a> would reference this site on the second or third page. As of now, I'm #2 for Leave it Behind and #4 for Brian Bailey. To show you how dynamic Google is, yesterday I was briefly the #1 result for Brian Bailey. </p>

<p>Google rankings are the stock market of the 21st century, with less risk and more fun!</p>
