title: Change Versus More of the Same

<p>About two months ago, I changed the subtitle of my blog to Change Versus More of the Same. I love that phrase and it captures how I feel about blogging and so much else. Though I love stability and sameness in many areas, there is part of me that absolutely loves to be involved in something new. I crave new ideas and direction and the possibilities that come with them, though that's not always my first reaction! Of course, I had no idea what was on the horizon.</p>

<p>As many of you have gathered from the blogosphere, Fellowship Church has recently experienced a wave of change that has impacted many areas. In my case, the change comes in the form of <a href="http://www.terrystorch.com/2005/08/really_wheres_t.html">Terry Storch's new role as the Campus Pastor</a> of our Uptown Dallas location. Terry has been my friend, mentor, and manager for my entire five years at Fellowship Church, and I am comforted by the fact that only one of those roles has changed. </p>

<p>Let me say a couple of quick things about Terry. </p>

<p>The dude will mess you up.</p>

<p>Seriously.</p>

<p>I have never been around a more relentless person. Working for Terry is truly a mind-altering experience. He is constantly looking three steps into the future. Terry doesn't see limitations or weaknesses, only potential and possibilities. While you're finalizing the details on the latest project, he is whiteboarding the next two. While you're listing the reasons why one of his ideas won't work, he's wondering why it isn't done yet. While you're thinking &quot;that's probably good enough&quot;, Terry is looking for excellence.</p>

<p>The last five years have constantly challenged my view of myself and what is possible. I have had to fight all of my natural inertia and learn to not settle or be satisfied, and to never put limits on what God can do.</p>

<p>Is it simply because he's a driven leader? That's certainly part of it, but there's much more.</p>

<p>Terry is the way he is because of his heart for Christ. He understand at his very core what is at stake each and every day. Once you come to terms with the lives that are hanging in the balance, and what God can do if we get out of His way, there is no holding back.</p>

<p>Terry is so passionate about people that I can't imagine a better person to lead the Uptown Campus. His creativity, drive, and leadership will challenge the staff and members like never before. </p>

<p>His vision for technology will be greatly missed. I spent these five years learning WWTD - What Would Terry Do? My instincts got to the point where my guesses were right about 90% of the time, but there was always something new - a different perspective or an option I never thought of - that threw me off. </p>

<p>I don't relish the thought of doing ministry without his leadership, but I know that change leads to growth. I have no doubt that God will grow Terry through this experience, and I can only pray the same for myself and all of us who've had the privilege of learning from him. </p>
