<p>Here's something cool. My son is in third grade and takes part in a neat program his school offers called Leap. He spends about three hours a week with a smaller group of kids focusing on creative, challenging projects. Each year, much of their effort is spent on a research project, growing in complexity as he gets older. This year, he choose the subject of geysers and has been reading and taking notes for the past two months.</p>

<p>The next step is to write the final report and design a presentation. Here's where things get interesting. He has many options for his presentation, from traditional report, to PowerPoint, to a sculpture, play, or poem. Ben is going to <strong>create a weblog featuring the fictional journal</strong> of an explorer searching for the ultimate geyser. The weblog will be a series of posts detailing his quest, part fiction (the search) and part research (details on the geysers and their locations). He's also planning on creating a photo album from the many websites he's visited.</p>

<p>I thought this was a very clever use of weblogs. And kudos to his teacher for being open to it. I'll post a link when it's complete.<br /> </p>
