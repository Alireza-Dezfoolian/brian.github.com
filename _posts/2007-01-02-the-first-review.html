<p>The first official review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">The Blogging Church</a> is out! <strong>Ministry Today Magazine</strong> has posted its <a href="http://www.ministrytodaymag.com/tools/2006/12/executive-summary-blogging-church.html">review online</a>. Here's an excerpt:</p><blockquote><p>In our world of computerized communications, weblogs, or blogs, are
part of a new revolution. The Blogging Church, by Brian Bailey with
Terry Storch, proves a compelling case for capitalizing on that trend
and provides clear instructions for venturing into the blogosphere. The
authors thoroughly explain blogs, not only discussing costs and related
factors, but also revealing how typical congregations with very little
tech know-how can get started.</p>

<p>Ideal Reader: Church leaders
and followers of Christ who hope to find simple, practical and
successful ways to use blogging for promoting a local church and
reaching the lost.</p>

<p>Rate the book from 1 (poor) to 5
(excellent) on these criteria: Practicality (5); Insight (5);
Theological Depth (3); Readability (5)</p></blockquote>

<p>I call it the first &quot;official&quot; review because up until this point, all of the feedback on the book has been from friends, relatives, or people who are actually<em>&nbsp;</em>featured in the book - in other words, not exactly an impartial jury. Thanks to Matt Green for his kind words!<br /><a href="http://www.ministrytodaymag.com/tools/2006/12/executive-summary-blogging-church.html"><br />Read the Full Review</a></p>
