<p>Don't worry, I won't be turning this site into a poor man's <a href="http://www.slickdeals.net/">Slick Deals</a>. I just had to pass along a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> offer I came across. I love the paper, but it's quite an expense. A year subscription (now 6 days a week, by the way) is typically $210 a year, or $0.70 a day.</p>

<p>Since I've never been willing to swallow that expense, I stop by <a href="http://wsj.com">the online version</a> consistently and decided to see if they were offering a special holiday rate. I was shocked to see an actual, honest-to-goodness WSJ sale! You can get a full year subscription (plus the standard 4-free weeks) for <strong>$99!</strong> A total of 56 weeks at $0.32 per day.</p>

<p><a href="https://services.wsj.com/Gryphon/jsp/retentionController.jsp?page=269&amp;S=63JWAJ">Here's the subscription page</a>.</p>

<p>I know most of you couldn't be less interested, but I bet there's a few that just found one more Christmas present to put under the tree. By the way, there's no indication of how long the offer lasts.</p>

<p>If you love excellent writing, news, politics, business, investing, and provocative editorials, you can't go wrong. Unfortunately, they also rate $1000 picnic baskets and only review cars over $40K, but that's a small price to pay. Especially now :)</p>
