<p>The most elegant piece of computer hardware I have ever seen arrived this morning, the recently improved Apple 12" Powerbook! Having spent nearly all of my time in the land of Windows over the past 10 years, I can honestly say there is nothing to fully prepare you for the Mac experience. The number of subtle (battery charge indication within the power cord) and not-so-subtle (drop-dead gorgeous looks and perfect balance between form and function) elements is staggering.</p>

<p>I ran out to the Apple store to find something worthy of this to carry it around. I found a decent bag, but it looks like I will have to return it as it's just a bit too small.</p>

<p>I spent the evening packing for my trip tomorrow and sharing the Powerbook with Ben, who was suitably impressed.</p>
