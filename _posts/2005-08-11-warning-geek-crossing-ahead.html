<p>Writing this series on COFFEE development has been very fun. I have received a lot of great feedback and interesting questions, which I hope to incorporate into the remaining installments. However, sometimes a more in-depth answer is required - one that is of extreme interest to a small number of people, but of only passing interest to others.</p>

<p>Well, now there is a place for the true geeks among us.<br /><span style="font-size: 1.2em;"><a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/code"><br />Leave It Behind &gt; Code</a></span></p>

<p>This is a home for people who actually <em>do</em> web development, as opposed to those of us who just think about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/08/open.html">My last post</a> was on the O in COFFEE development, which stands for Open. In it, I wrote:</p><blockquote><p>When you share your own contribution, you play a valuable role in leaving something behind for the next team who wants to grow software.</p></blockquote><p>This new site is our place to answer questions, share knowledge, and share code. I use the word <em>our</em> because it will be a collaborative effort of the Fellowship Church Web Team. I use the word&nbsp; <em>collaborative</em> to mask the fact that I won't be contributing anything of value other than spell check.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/code/2005/08/geocoding_googl.html">The first post</a> is on how we solved the missing geocoding piece in the Google API for our recent site release. We'll post some code samples shortly.</p>

<p>If anyone would like to share any code or web development solutions, let me know. Whenever there's a post on the new blog I'll link to it from here.</p>
