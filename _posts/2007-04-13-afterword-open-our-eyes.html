title: "Afterword: Open Our Eyes"

<p>When we start blogging, our eyes are wide open and we eagerly seek out information anywhere we can find it. We're naturally curious in the same way as when we move into a new neighborhood, apartment complex, or dorm. We want to meet the guy next door or the friendly couple down the street.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Sadly, this tends to be a temporary inclination. After a few months of learning and growing and seeking out new friends, we begin to turn inward. We become obsessed with our own voice and those who think like we do. Instead of looking for opportunities to connect with a lost world, we turn our backs and close our eyes. </p>

<p>We have to resist the temptation to make it all about us. Often it appears that our passions are simply new music, edgy movies and great reads. Why are our priorities nothing more than cool cell phones, reality television, and <em>24</em>?&nbsp; Sometimes we use our blogs to promote everything <em>but</em> God and his church. </p>

<p>Should a blog be personal? Of course! The honesty and openness of a blog is one of its defining characteristics. Have fun with your blog. Use it as an outlet to try out ideas, post pictures of a night out with friends or your daughter's birthday party, and tell stories. There doesn’t have to be a hidden agenda behind every thought or phrase. Your blog should reflect who you are, your priorities and your passions.&nbsp; </p>

<p>What those are, though, may surprise you. An honest blog, like a well-placed mirror, can sometimes reveal things about ourselves that we'd rather not see. The time and energy that is poured into a blog can reflect misplaced priorities. The feedback and notoriety, the blogging spotlight, is hard to resist and you may find yourself pursuing traffic instead of people. The blog should never become an end in itself instead of a means to an end. </p>

<p>This message is meant for me as much as anyone. Every blogger struggles with the desire for notoriety and the slippery slope to self-importance. We like to present ourselves as something we really aren’t – a leadership guru or expert on all-things-church. If I'm not currently guilty of what I describe here, I have been in the past.&nbsp; </p>

<p>A healthy blog, like a healthy church or ministry, reaches both the curious and the already convinced. It's a place where questions are asked, different viewpoints expressed and people are treated with respect. If a new program or ministry does not reach people or help people, it's not worth doing. The same is true for a blog.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Don't let your eyes become closed to the people who desperately need to hear the Good News. Use your blog to reach out to others as you share your life, your struggles and triumphs, and everything that makes you who you are. Open your eyes and your heart to the people who God has placed within your sphere of influence so that His love can be revealed. </p>

<p>There is no blogging revolution without others. We are here for a reason, and that reason is to point people to the living savior. Our life should reflect that, and so should our blog. </p>
