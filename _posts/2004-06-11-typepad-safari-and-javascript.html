<p>Does anyone know where the problem lies between TypePad and Safari? When you create a post in TypePad, there are a series of buttons available for various HTML tags (bold, italic, link, underline, email, and blockquote). Unfortunately, these buttons do not show up in Safari. </p>

<p>I found a brief <a href="http://www.mineblogging.com/blog/2003/11/typepad_over_ib.html">mention of the problem</a> through a Google search that suggests the problem lies with Safari's JavaScript incompatibility.</p>

<p>One thing that perplexes me, however, is the newest buttons (insert file and insert picture) work as expected. So who should we look to for a fix, TypePad or Apple?</p>
