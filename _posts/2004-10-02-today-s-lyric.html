<p>I believe in the love that you gave me<br />
I believe in the faith that could save me<br />
I believe in the hope<br />
and I pray that some day<br />
It may raise me above these badlands</p>

<p>For the ones who had a notion,<br />
a notion deep inside<br />
That it ain't no sin<br />
to be glad you're alive<br />
I wanna find one face<br />
that ain't looking through me<br />
I wanna find one place,<br />
I wanna spit in the face of these badlands</p>

<p>> Bruce Springsteen > Badlands > Nebraska</p>
