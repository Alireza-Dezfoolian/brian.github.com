<p>A terrific <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=221089&amp;cc=5901">Gold Cup final</a> today saw the United States beat Mexico 2-1. The was one of the most entertaining soccer matches I have seen in some time - very fast paced and high energy. There were some excellent plays throughout the 90 intense minutes, with the U.S. coming from behind to win. I always say that there isn't anything like international soccer in front of a packed stadium of passionate fans and that was the case again today.</p>

<p>At this point, I'm left with no choice but to jump on the Bob Bradley bandwagon. The new U.S. coach is now 10-0-1 since taking over the national team earlier this year. Though I was one of those who wanted a high profile foreign coach, Bradley has proven himself to be both innovative and determined. His clean record will likely take a hit over the next two weeks as the U.S. takes an inexperienced squad to a tournament in South America, but he clearly has the team on the right track.</p>
