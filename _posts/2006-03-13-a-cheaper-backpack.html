<p><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/backpack_premium_now_14month.php">37signals dropped the price</a> of the premium Backpack plan today from $19 to $14 per month. Now there are <a href="http://backpackit.com/upgrade/">four simple price points</a> - free, $5, $9, and $14 per month.</p>

<p>I use Backpack for organizing every part of my personal and professional life, and even to <a href="http://www.bloggingchurch.com">write a book</a>. Just when I thought my addiction was leveling off, <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/backpack_premium_now_14month.php">Jason drops a hint</a> that some form of calendaring may be added in the near future. This could be very cool.</p>

<p>If you haven't grabbed yourself a Backpack account yet, <a href="http://backpackit.com/?referrer=BPZZS">sign-up now for free</a> and see what you've been missing.</p>
