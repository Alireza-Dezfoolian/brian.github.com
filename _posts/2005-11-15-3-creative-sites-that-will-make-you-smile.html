<p>Sometimes, you come across things that just blow you away. It's so rare to find things truly creative things online. As we all know, most web design is finding something you like and making it better. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's fun to come across something new.</p>

<p>A musicians website that has to be experienced to be believed. There's music, dancing, and lots of polaroids. Just click everywhere, there's surprises around every corner. Bonus points if you can find where he does his best, "Don't mess with Texas". Note: you may want to use your headphones when you visit.

<p>Predictably, the people who built the Billy Harvey site have a very cool site of their own. Just click the bottom boxes and you'll slowly move through the site. You'll notice the music volume and style changes as you move. The last page even features a song begging you not to leave. If you skip a few boxes and click further down the line, the pages and music rush past. </p>

<p>I wonder if this could work for a student's website?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pixelpeach.com/3.0/">Pixel Peach Studio</a></p>

<p>This Austin-based design company has a very good Flash site. They do a terrific job of matching the design to the name and there's a lot of clever elements to the site. </p>

<p><strong>But there's one thing you can't miss.</strong> Hover over the Our Work peach in the middle (don't you love Flash navigation...ha!) and you'll see the options web, print and photos. When you click photos, you'll find yourself on the first page of a photo album.</p>

<p>Now here's the part where you're going to lose about 15 minutes of your life. </p>

<p>Click the bottom right-corner of the page, just like a real photo album, and drag the page to your left. <strong>You are literally turning the page</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, have fun with it. Watch how the next photo is on the back of the page as you're turning it. Bend the page left to right and top to bottom. Watch how the next photo gets lighter as you turn the page. Seriously, just keep playing with it - you'll be amazed at what it does.</p>

<p>I don't know if this is old school to you Flash gurus, but <strong>this is the coolest thing I have ever seen in Flash.</strong></p>

<p>Of course, I'm sure these three sites were inspired by others, but they each put a smile on my face. The funny thing is that I always tell people I don't like Flash sites. <em>Well done!</em> </p>

<p>What sites have you seen lately that were truly different?</p>
