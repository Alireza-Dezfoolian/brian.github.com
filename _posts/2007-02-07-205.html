Thanks to some timely promotion and <em>viewers like you</em>, the book reached an <strong>Amazon sales rank of #205</strong> yesterday evening, nearly breaking the Top 200. In my wildest dreams, I never thought the book would reach that high. It was also #10 in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/5/ref=pd_ts_b_nav/002-6847152-0888045">Computers &amp; Internet</a> (take that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/World-Warcraft-Burning-Official-Strategy/dp/0744008336/ref=pd_ts_b_20/002-6847152-0888045?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">World of Warcraft Strategy Guide</a>!) and #31 in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/22/ref=pd_ts_b_nav/002-6847152-0888045">Religion &amp; Spirituality</a>. I don't expect it to remain quite so high for very long, so I thought I should document the occasion. Jossey-Bass also reported recently that the totals from the first two weeks were way beyond their expectations.&nbsp; I couldn't be more blessed, and am so thankful to God for every part of this process. It's truly been a God-thing from beginning to end.</p>

<p>Since the sales rank numbers are updated hourly, I'm sure the book will quickly adjust to more reasonable level and I can return to thinking about more important things. Like the fact that Ben talked to a girl on the phone last night (o.k., it was about the <a href="http://us.wii.com/">Wii</a>, but still). In the meantime, thanks for making the launch a success!</p>
