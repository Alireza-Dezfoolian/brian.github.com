<p>Here's a well-done overview by InfoWorld on the implications of recent anti-spam legislation on organizations who regularly communicate with customers or members via email: <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/02/27/09FEspamlaw_1.html">Are You a Spammer?</a></p>

<p>Some highlights:</p>

<p>1. All commercial email must include a valid <b>postal address</b> for the organization, preferably a street address and not a P.O. box.</p>

<p>2. For full compliance with the law, the subscribe check box should not be checked for the user. He or she should have to check the box to subscribe.</p>

<p>3. All commercial email must include an opt-out mechanism that takes affect within 10 days.</p>

<p>4. When opting out of a list, the user should be presented with all of their subscriptions and be given an opportunity to unsubscribe from as many as desired.</p>

<p>The article mentions <a href="http://constantcontact.com/">Constant Contact</a> as an excellent source of full-compliant email services.<br />
