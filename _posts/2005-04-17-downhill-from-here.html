<p>Ben and I went for an hour hike this afternoon around a local lake. When we got about half way, I asked him if he wanted to go back along the trail or just follow the road. He cheerfully chose the trail. &quot;After all,&quot; he said, &quot;on the way back, all of our downhills will be uphills and all of our uphills will be downhills.&quot;</p>

<p>So true.</p>

<p>We all face difficult challenges and paths that are harder than we'd like. But rather than exit the trail and take the road, turn back around and take the trail once more. You'll find the route will be different this time, and is far more rewarding.</p>
