<p>According to <a href="http://www.hackingnetflix.com/netflix/2004/09/netflix_launche.html">HackingNetflix.com</a>, Netflix has at last released RSS feeds. Not only do they include community feeds such as top rentals and new releases, but you can generate a personal feed for your own queue and rental history.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am currently a Blockbuster customer, so I can only hope that Blockbuster continues to flatter Netflix with their imitation!</p>
