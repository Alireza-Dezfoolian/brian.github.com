<p>We spent sun up 'til sun down with the IT Director at Willow Creek in Chicago, a true pleasure and privilege. Through the course of the day we were able to ask endless questions, see much of the behind-the-scenes operation, meet much of the IT staff, and tour the existing campus, as well as the magnificent new 7,200+ seat auditorium due to open in the fall. The time was immensely helpful as we compared, contrasted, questioned, and learned from one of the truly great churches in America.</p>
