<p>Please forgive the obvious and revealing geek-ness of this, but here are <a href="http://pix.glennf.com/photos/040529_seattle_library/index.html">some great photos</a> of the brand new public library in Seattle (via <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Robert Scoble</a>). The Bailey's are just the type to incorporate this into a future Washington vacation! One of things we miss most from our nine months in Chicago is the wonderful public libraries in that area. The libraries in Texas are actually quite good, but with no state income tax, they are slighty more limited than other states.</p>
