<p>Do you have a passion for the web and the local church?
<a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com">Fellowship Church</a> is looking for a .NET web developer to join our team.
You will be pushed and challenged every day to reach and serve our four
diverse web communities with creative excellence. If you want to use
your love of web development within a dynamic church, Fellowship is the
place for you. <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com/FCWeb/aboutfellowship/fcjobs.aspx?pgId=191">Click here</a> for the job description and requirements.<br /><br />This is our first web hire since weblogs have gone mainstream and should present some interesting dynamics. For the first time, a prospective hire can learn a lot about the team and leadership through weblogs. And, I would hope (expect?) that our prospective hire would also have an online home where we can learn about his or her skills, interests, and way of thinking.<br /><br />If you know someone, or if you <em>are</em> the someone, <a href="mailto:brian@leaveitbehind.com">let me know</a>. And you get bonus points if you know what the title of this post is from!</p>
