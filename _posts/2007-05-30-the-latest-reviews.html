<p>So many people have posted reviews of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">The Blogging Church</a> on their blogs or on Amazon these past few months that I can't acknowledge them all without turning this into a very boring blog. My sincere thanks to everyone who has purchased the book and taken the time to share their thoughts - the feedback is very helpful and always interesting!</p>



<p>I do want to single out one very thorough and generous review. This was by <a href="http://godbit.com/article/blogging-church">Nathan Smith on Godbit</a>, an excellent resource site for web designers who care about web standards.</p>

<blockquote><p>For those of you who have been blogging for awhile, as you’re reading through this book, you will find many insights which you will agree with already. I think this book would be an ideal gift to a pastor. It masterfully describes the benefits of letting people hear an authentic voice. Much like blogging, the book’s brevity lends to its impact.
