<p>Three months ago today, I wrote about Fellowship Church's <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/03/why_switch.html">switch from .NET to Open Source</a> for our websites. Today, we release the first result of that transition.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.edyoung.org">the new EdYoung.org</a>!</p>

<p>This site is the online home of Ed's national radio and television ministry. The look is not radically different than the previous version, but behind the scenes, it is literally a brand-new site, incorporating nearly all of the <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/06/tools_of_the_tr.html">tools I listed here</a>.</p>

<p>1. The site is our first to be hosted with the fine folks at <a href="http://colo4dallas.com/">CoLo4Dallas</a>.</p>

<p>2. It uses CSS for nearly every display element. My team became rather obsessive about this.</p>

<p>3. The site is built to fully support web standards, and almost every page's HTML validates 100%.</p>

<p>4. The load times throughout have been reduced by at least half. You could actually enjoy this site on a dial-up connection.</p>

<p>5. It is built to scale from a cell phone to the largest display and to your printer. Yes, we have actually surfed EdYoung.org from our cell phones!</p>

<p>6. Of course, the site use open source at its core, including PHP, Apache, Linux, and PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>We still use a site-in-a-box online store, that violates nearly every one of these things, but we hope to find or develop a replacement down the road.</p>

<p>Congratulations to Brad and Jeph who worked very hard to take this site to a whole new level. Each time they faced an opportunity to cut corners they insisted on doing it right. Your commitment to excellence shows!</p>

<p>Take a look around and let us know what you think! </p>
