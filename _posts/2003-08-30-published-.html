<p>Unbelievably, I have made my first appearance in print! The Dallas Morning News has just published an article on spiritual blogs and the use of weblogs within churches. I was interviewed for the story and actually made the final cut. My section was entitled "The Internet Church", but unfortunately the article is no longer available online, so I've included it here.</p>

<blockquote>Ed Young's Fellowship Church in Grapevine is so Internet savvy that it displays its web site on the church's buildings. But the mega-church has yet to jump on the blogging bandwagon.

<p>Internet manager Brian Bailey said the church is considering using blogs internally for its staff. The church also may provide blogs for pastors who attend its conferences. But, he said, there's a huge ethical minefield that needs to be tackled before churches allow staff and members to have blogs, or churches to host blogs.</p>

<p>"We have to figure out how to monitor these blogs, and have clear guidelines about what can and cannot be discussed," he said. "What if somebody posts confidential things, or things that they disagree with leadership about? In a church, we must have a higher standard. Obviously, you wouldn't want anyone writing about someone's counseling session."</blockquote></p>

<p>As this is the first time I have ever had my name in print, we handled it in the mandatory fashion, including picking up multiple copies of the paper at the store. Ben seemed very excited and impressed to see his dad's name in the article.</p>

<p>I have to say that the experience was better than I could have imagined. The author, Susan, was very easy to work with and more than accomodating.</p>
