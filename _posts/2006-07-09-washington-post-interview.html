<p>I was recently privileged to be interviewed for a Washington Post article that just went to press. You can <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/08/AR2006070800862.html">find it online</a> or in the Sunday print edition. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/08/AR2006070800862.html">Cyber-Savvy Pastors Blog When the Spirit Moves Them</a></p>

<p>This is one of the best articles on blogging pastors that I've come across. It does an excellent job of capturing the many different ways pastors use blogs, including outreach, vision casting, shared learning, and personal reflection. The reporter, Megan Greenwell, was a joy to work with and her skills and enthusiasm for the subject shine through. The focus of the piece is on DC and Virginia-area bloggers, including <a href="http://www.evotional.com">Mark Batterson</a> and <a href="http://www.benarment.com/">Ben Arment</a>. </p>

<p>Now, I just need to find a bookstore in Dallas that carries the Post!</p>
