<p>Next week, Lori, Ben and I will leave for our long-awaited summer vacation! We're driving to St. Louis to spend a few days with Lori's brother and family, who are driving from Michigan. We're so excited that Ben will get to spend some time with two of his cousins - summer just doesn't seem like summer without cousins.</p>

<p>We're staying in downtown St. Louis, one block from <a href="http://www.stlouisarch.com/">the Arch</a> and one block from the <a href="http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/stl/ballpark/index.jsp">Cardinal's new stadium</a>. We will even get to enjoy fourth of July fireworks right on the river, underneath the Arch, in the heart of the midwest. What could be more American than that?</p>

<p>It still feels like a miracle that this vacation is going to happen, because it means that <a href="http://www.bloggingchurch.com">the book</a> is finished and the <a href="http://www.creativepastors.com">new website</a> is live. What's funny is that I've always known that a website is <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2006/06/the_allnew_crea.html">never really finished</a>, but I had no idea that a book is never actually done.</p>

<p>One of our favorite movies is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103241/">What About Bob?</a> Do you remember the scene when Dr. Leo Marvin attempts to convince his family that Bob (Bill Murray) has never really left. "You think he's gone? He's not gone! That's the whole point! He's never gone!" That's exactly what writing a book is like.</p>

<blockquote>You think it's done? It's not done! That's the whole point! The book is never done!
</blockquote>
<p>In the three weeks since I turned in the "final" draft, I've been contacted by four different <a href="http://www.josseybass.com/WileyCDA/">Jossey-Bass</a> employees about a bio, release forms for contributors, author photo, forward, and, probably the most fun topic, book cover design. This is in addition to a fresh round of edits to the initial manuscript and long before we get to the actual proofs and marketing. Now I have it in my mind that the book will be done when I hold it in my hands, but in a way, that's just the beginning - you have to actually sell it, afterall!</p>

<p>So, I face one more book deadline before the trip, but after that, it should be a care-free few days! What are some of the cool vacations you guys have planned for this summer?</p>
