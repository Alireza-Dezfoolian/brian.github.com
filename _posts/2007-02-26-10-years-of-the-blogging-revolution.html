<p><a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=4541">Interesting post by Dan Farber</a> on the first 10 years of blogging and the wonderful and equally frustrating impact it has had. In April, <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> will celebrate 10 years of blogging, which was the impetus for the article. Dave was the first blogger I ever read and I actually launched <strong>Leave It Behind</strong> officially on April 1, 2004 because I thought my blog should share a birth date with the site that inspired me.</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">Blogging</a> is a democratizing force on a large scale; the tools of production for personal expression are in the hands of the masses.</p></blockquote><p>Farber estimates &quot;about 70 million blogs have been created–tens of thousands per day sprout up.&quot; More and more, I'm coming across people who are starting blogs or moving their blog in a new direction after reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">The Blogging Church</a>. It's an honor to play a small part in new people joining the conversation. <a href="http://brandnewheart.wordpress.com/2007/02/24/a-new-start/">Doug Dale wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Reading Brian Bailey’s book The Blogging Church was my inspiration. It helped me with some of the “how” of blogging, but more importantly it helped me with the “why”. If I can keep the “why” in mind, I think my blogging experience can be more of what I had hoped for.</p>

<p>Check out the book, particularly if you are involved in church leadership, and learn how blogging can be one more tool to communicate with people both inside and outside your church.</p></blockquote>

<p>Stop by <a href="http://brandnewheart.wordpress.com/">Doug's site</a> and say hello. Here are a few other links to recent reviews and comments:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.misterorange.com/2007/02/family-matters-week-of-2-18-07-with.html">Evan Erwin</a> - &quot;The book covers pretty much every major blogging issue that there is to talk about.&quot; Evan also writes about something he felt wasn't emphasized enough in the book and what to do about it (<em>disclaimer</em>: Evan is <em>in</em> the book).</p>

<p><a href="http://hostit1.connectria.com/twduff/home.nsf/d6plinks/TDUF-6YR4W9">Thomas Duff</a> - &quot;This is an extremely well-written book, with far-reaching implications to your ministry.&nbsp; For anyone who is serious about using every available means to extend your outreach, this is a must-read book.&quot;</p>
