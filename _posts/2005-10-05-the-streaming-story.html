<p>Thanks for all the <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/10/new_flash_strea.html#comments">great feedback on our new video streaming</a>. The first 48 hours have exceeded our expectations, with thousands of viewers, many raves, and not a single report of trouble.</p>

<p>We've posted the <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/code/2005/10/streaming_video.html">first in a series</a> on our solution. <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/code/2005/10/streaming_video.html">Part One</a> covers how we got here and some of the highlights of the new software. More of the technical details are on there way. If you have specific code and server questions, feel free to leave them on the <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/code/">Code site</a> and we'll answer them.</p>
