<p>When I finally decided to use <a href="http://www.typepad.com">Typepad</a> for my weblog, I had to step away from my lengthy experiment with <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio Userland</a>, a desktop-based weblog editor and newsreader. After a month of use, here is my comparison of the two.</p>

<p><b>Best things about Typepad</b></p>

<p>1. Post from any computer, anywhere<br />
2. Elegant, intuitive, Mac-like, user interface<br />
3. Bug-free software<br />
4. Continual development and improvement<br />
5. Advanced features such as domain mapping<br />
6. Excellent help system, knowledge base, and customer service</p>

<p><b>Best things about Radio Userland</b></p>

<p>1. Local weblog copy, allowing local backups and the ability to work without a network connection<br />
2. Complete control and ability to access the innerworkings of the system<br />
3. Built-in newsreader<br />
4. Categories can reside in different locations and generate individual feeds.<br />
5. Price</p>

<p>Based on my priorities, it wasn't a terribly hard decision. I love the freedom to update from anywhere, and love the quality of Typepad. Radio was in a lengthy development slump and I was unlikely to use a good deal of the underlying power it offered. </p>

<p>Another way to look at it is, if a beginner wanted to start her own weblog and asked me for a recommendation, I would choose Typepad above all others. The best part is, I don't know why a power user would choose otherwise, either. </p>
