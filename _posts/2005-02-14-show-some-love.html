<p>On this Valentine's Day, I thought I'd show some love to a great friend of mine, Eloy Ramirez. <a href="http://www.servoisverus.com/keepin_it_real/">Keepin' it Real</a> is a blog dedicated entirely to the subject of love: his love for his wife, his son, his Savior and the lost. Eloy writes with a passion that you can't ignore. I find his writing and his pictures to be consistently inspiring. <a href="http://www.servoisverus.com/keepin_it_real/">Take a look</a>.</p>
