<p>I had the pleasure of being interviewed for three podcasts over the past week. The first one was with <a href="http://www.djchuang.com/">DJ Chuang</a> of Leadership Network. It was great talking to DJ after reading his blog for so long. You can <a href="http://books.leadnet.org/2007/03/interview_with_.html">listen to the interview here</a>.</p>

<p>Next, I spoke with <a href="http://oakgrovemedia.typepad.com/jay/">Jay Kelly</a> with <a href="http://wiredparish.com/">WiredParish</a>, a Christian podcasting network. Jay really knows his stuff and fired a lot of great questions. I knew I had to do the interview when I learned that Jay is pursuing a PhD in philosophy (my college major) and when he referenced The Ramones in a post. How could I say no?</p>

<p>The final interview was with Harold Check of <a href="http://www.sixapart.com">Six Apart</a> for the <a href="http://books.typepad.com/podcasts/">TypePad Books Podcast</a>. Each month, they interview one of the many book authors who use TypePad. I was honored to be chosen - recent podcasts have featured <a href="http://books.typepad.com/podcasts/2007/01/ben_mcconnell_a.html">Ben McConnell &amp; Jackie Huba</a>, <a href="http://books.typepad.com/podcasts/2006/08/seth_godin_smal.html">Seth Godin</a>, and <a href="http://books.typepad.com/podcasts/2006/07/chris_anderson_.html">Chris Anderson</a>. Harold is a great guy and it was a fun interview. I love when people outside of the church world get exposed to the book, not because it will help sales (which I doubt), but just so people might hear and think about church in a different way.</p>

<p>The TypePad and WiredParish interviews should be online later this week.</p>
