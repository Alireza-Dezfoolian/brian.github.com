<p><a href="http://www.cioinsight.com/print_article2/0,1217,a=165734,00.asp">Ed Cone's article</a> for CIO Insight magazine on how megachurches utilize technology is now online.&nbsp; I had the pleasure of being <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/10/interview.html">interviewed by Ed in October</a>, along with a number of Fellowship staff, and the article turned out great. There are a number of terrific churches profiled, including <a href="http://www.willowcreek.org">Willow Creek</a>, <a href="http://www.saddleback.com">Saddleback</a>, and <a href="http://www.seacoastchurch.org">Seacoast</a>.</p>
