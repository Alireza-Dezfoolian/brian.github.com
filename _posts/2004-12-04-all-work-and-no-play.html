<p><a href="http://www.mightygoods.com/">Mighty Goods</a>. A shopping weblog of cool stuff (via <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/">Signal vs. Noise</a>).</p>



<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/28/magazine/28PHENOM.html?ex=1259384400&amp;en=2331603dc0efbf47&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland">The Play's the Thing</a>. NYT tells the story of <a href="http://www.cranium.com/home.asp">Cranium</a> and the philosophy behind the company - creating games where no one has to feel like an idiot. Best quote: &quot;Does anyone ever finish a game of Monopoly and not hate someone at the table?&quot;</p>



<p>My family absolutely loves playing games and Cranium makes a few of the best. <a href="http://www.gamewright.com/gwintro.html">Gamewright</a> also makes a number of excellent games that have given us hours of fun, especially <a href="http://www.gamewright.com/gamewright/index.php?section=games&amp;page=game&amp;show=61">Rat-a-Tat-Cat</a> and <a href="http://www.gamewright.com/gamewright/index.php?section=games&amp;page=game&amp;show=93">Scrambled States</a>. Many fun gift ideas and great ways to spend some of the holidays away from the television and computer!</p>
