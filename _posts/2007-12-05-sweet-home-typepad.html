<p>A few of you may have noticed that I've returned to <a href="http://www.typepad.com">TypePad</a>, after my short affair with <a href="http://www.tumblr.com">tumblr</a>. Most of you haven't noticed and have no reason to care one way or the other - you have my complete support and understanding. Someone's choice of blogging tool is just slightly more interesting than someone's choice of bank, so I wouldn't pay much attention either. For the rest of you, read on for a brief story about the switch (back).</p>

<p>I love tumblr. Really, really love tumblr. In fact, my son Ben continues to use it and I'm jealous of him just about every day. The decision came down to two things: the past and the future.</p>

<p><strong>The Past</strong></p>

<p>I mentioned when I moved to tumblr that I was still trying to decide what to do with over 3 years of TypePad posts. The answer? Not a whole lot. If you want to keep your content online and you don't want to break links (whether from others or search engines), there just aren't any good options other than paying Six Apart to keep the blog live indefinitely. I actually think blogging companies should offer a lifetime archive option, which would host your content for as long as they are in business for a one-time fee, though you would not be able to make changes or additions. But since that service doesn't exist, I had to decide whether I was willing to pay for something I was no longer using or export the content to a free web host and break all existing links. I wasn't willing to do either.</p>

<p><strong>The Future</strong></p>

<p>At the same time that this was going on, I was in the process of deciding on the best blogging option for a family project we're working on. It's a very fun idea that has all three of us working feverishly each weekend, brainstorming ideas and then trying to make them happen. There were a few things I was just sure couldn't be done in TypePad that I recently discovered were not only possible but easy. It quickly became clear that TypePad is the perfect platform for what we're doing. The fact that it is the right choice for the next thing maked the decision about <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/">Leave It Behind</a> a simple one. </p>

<p>TypePad is a powerful tool that's enjoyable to use, and no one can compete with their support. I was reminded of this through both their recent help and the multiple unanswered emails to tumblr. I don't fault the tumblr team for this - it's a free service that is only recently moving from a hobby to a business. The main issue is I was trying to use tumblr in a way that it's really not designed to be used.</p>

<p>I hope to post more about the next thing soon!</p>
