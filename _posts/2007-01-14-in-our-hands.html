<p><span class="plogBodyText">The final
release of the book is in my hands! It arrived late Friday.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/bookbox.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=626,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="200" height="195" border="0" alt="Bookbox" title="Bookbox" src="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/images/bookbox.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
The
book contract sets aside copies of the book for the authors. <a href="http://loribailey.wordpress.com">Lori</a> called me late in the afternoon to tell me that 2 boxes from Wiley
Publishing had just been delivered. When I got home, we shared a fun
family moment as we opened the first box and each grabbed a copy. My
11-year old son, Ben, was kind enough to read a chapter tonight, but he
refuses to post a review until he reads the whole thing :)<br /><br />I
have to say, I'm immensely pleased. Wiley and Jossey-Bass did a
fantastic job assembling the final version. The galleys did not prepare
me for how nice the release would be. A simple example is the back
cover, which wa<a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/bookback_1.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=816,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="200" height="255" border="0" alt="Bookback_1" title="Bookback_1" src="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/images/bookback_1.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>s just plain text in the galley version. The new and
improved back cover and spine really tie the whole look together. The
final size and paper are just a touch different, but great
improvements as well. And most importantly, the content incorporates the
last two rounds of edits and is much more pleasant to read because of
it.<br /><br />If it's in our hands, that means it's only a matter of time
before it's in yours. I look forward to hearing your feedback and
reading through the first reviews!</span></p>

<p><span class="plogBodyText">Having the finished book arrived immediately made me think about how this process began. Through the greatness of Gmail, I quickly found the original, innocent email that started it all.</span></p>

<p><span class="plogBodyText">It was from <em>Naked Conversations</em> co-author <a href="http://redcouch.typepad.com/weblog/">Shel Israel</a>, who had just posted an interview with me on his book blog.</span></p>

<p><span class="plogBodyText">&quot;My acquisitions editorâ€”<a href="http://wroxblog.typepad.com/">Jim Minatel</a> at Wiley would like to talk with you about a book idea he has.&quot;&nbsp; That was on April&nbsp; 20, 2005. I never could have imagined the implications of that simple sentence, and that nearly two years later there would be a completed book. Thanks once again to Shel, <a href="http://www.scobleizer.com">Scoble</a> and Jim for making this possible!&nbsp; </span></p>
