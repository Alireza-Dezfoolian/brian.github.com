<p>I am endlessly fascinated by the average person's belief in his or her own abilities. Most of us are filled with doubt about who we are and why we are here. Most of us, in fact, question our success at the very responsibilities we carry out everyday - parenting, career, and relationships.</p>

<p>But that doesn't stop us from being 100% sure we can accomplish great things, given the opportunity. Despite little experience or inherent talent, we bravely assert our competency. The telling example is when you're watching a profile of someone on television, or skimming the classifieds, and you say, &quot;I could do that if I wanted.&quot; </p>

<p>And the person sitting next to you says, &quot;No, really, you couldn't.&quot;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;"><strong>Top 10 Things Everyone Thinks They Can Do</strong></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #3333ff;"><strong>10. Write song lyrics</strong></span> </p>

<p><em>She's got a smile that it seems to me<br />Reminds me of childhood memories </em></p>

<p>How hard can it be?</p>

<p><span style="color: #3333ff;"><strong>9. Design a website</strong></span></p>

<p>Every person who works on the web has received detailed design instruction from someone without a great deal of web experience. Usually the phrase <em>Comic Sans</em> is involved.</p>

<p><span style="color: #3333ff;"><strong>8. Write a children's book</strong></span></p>

<p>The fact that celebrities manage to do this on a regular basis causes much of the confusion.</p>

<p><span style="color: #3333ff;"><strong>7. Write movie reviews</strong></span></p>

<p>We all enjoy movies. We all enjoy talking about movies afterword. How difficult can it be to write your opinion down on a piece of paper?</p>

<p><span style="color: #3333ff;"><strong>6. Be a comedian</strong></span></p>

<p>I think deep down, we all think we're funny. And I think most of us believe that if we were able to spend our entire day working at it, we could be <em>really</em> funny. </p>

<p>Some of us would never want to be onstage, though. We just imagine being a writer for <em>SNL</em> or a late-night talk show instead.</p>

<p><span style="color: #3333ff;"><strong>5. Design a church service</strong></span></p>

<p>Everyone? Maybe not, but everyone who has ever been to church has left thinking, &quot;I would've used a better opening story. I didn't like that song. The drama was too long. Why does it have to be so cold?&quot;</p>

<p><span style="color: #3333ff;"><strong>4. Work in sports</strong></span></p>

<p>Mostly a guy thing, but in addition to the ones who were just an injury or lucky break away from stardom, there are those who think they would make a terrific broadcaster, coach, or sportswriter.</p>

<p><span style="color: #3333ff;"><strong>3. Write Top 10 lists</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #3333ff;"><strong>2. Write a book</strong></span></p>



<p>Fiction or non-fiction, I think most people think they have at least one book in them, just waiting for the right opportunity. And since very few of us know anyone who has actually written a book, the only examples we have to work with are found on television or in the movies. I must say, it looks like writing is a wonderful way to live.<br /><span style="color: #3333ff;"><strong><br />1. Name anything</strong></span> </p>



<p>It can be a child, book, website, product, or band, but I've never met someone who would pass up a chance to name something. And once you offer your opinion, any other choice is clearly a mistake. I still think I had a better name for my sister's own child!</p>

<p>Some of these things aren't very hard to do, they're just hard to do well. Not only am I guilty of just about all of these conceits, I actually admire the seemingly ingrained American confidence that anything is possible.</p>

<p>But that doesn't stop it from being funny. <em>Really, really funny.</em> </p>

<p><em>Man, I have </em><em><strong>got</strong> to send this one to Letterman.</em></p>
