<p>A vendor has informed us that Microsoft Business Solutions soon will no longer offer non-profit or charity pricing for their products, including Great Plains and RMS. This would have a significant impact on our organization, and I suspect many other churches and non-profits. Has anyone else heard this? Would anyone from Microsoft like to comment?</p>

<p>If it is true, it would be very helpful to have a list of products affected and a timeframe for the change.</p>
