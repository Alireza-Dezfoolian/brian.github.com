<p>If you do, take a minute to read <a href="http://www.tonywoodlief.com/">Tony Woodlief's</a> classic tale of hand washing: <a href="http://www.tonywoodlief.com/archives/001045.html">The Simple Things</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Finally, they [Tony's two young boys] step over to the towel and wave their hands around it while thinking dry thoughts. I've never seen anything like it - these boys can worry a towel half to death so that it's wound up and wrinkled and hanging by the thinnest of margins, yet leave the bathroom with hands dripping wet.</p></blockquote><p>I read this out loud with Lori and Ben and none of us could stop laughing. <em>Enjoy!</em></p>
