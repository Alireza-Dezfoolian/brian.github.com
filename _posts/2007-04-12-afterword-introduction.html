<p>The first time I read a blog was in 
2000. Since then, I've read thousands of posts and written 810 of my 
own. I've watched as blogs launched a presidential candidate and brought 
down a senator. I've seen companies changed, a voice given to the voiceless, 
people comforted in times of tragedy, and relationships formed that 
would have been impossible just a few years earlier.</p>
<p>And I've had a front-row seat as churches 
have joined the conversation. </p>
<p>In the past, the church often found 
itself on the sideline as new tools swept through our culture due to 
limited resources (human and otherwise) and an institutional resistance 
to change. This time, the local church is a (sometimes) willing participant 
in the revolution. Blogging is so simple and inexpensive that many churches, 
pastors, and staff members have made the leap into this brave new world 
and are experiencing the power of open and authentic communication.
</p>
<p>Many of you are already part of the 
blogging revolution. You've joined the conversation and blogging has 
become part of who you are, so much so that you no longer see a distinction 
between your <em>life</em> and your <em>online life</em>. For you, asking whether the 
church should use blogs is like asking whether the church should use 
the telephone or the internet. You see the limitations of broadcast 
marketing and four color brochures and the potential of blogging.
</p>
<p>The blogosphere is blessed with many 
innovative blogs written by pastors and people on the front lines of 
ministry. There are churches using blogs to reach and teach and share 
the life of the church.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the status quo looks 
quite different. The reality is that many blogs written by people in 
ministry reflect little of the promise of blogging or who God has called 
us to be. These blog are often filled with their own unique combination 
of pettiness, self-promotion, negativity, derision, and the all-consuming 
pursuit of traffic. </p>
<p>Blogging isn't worth doing poorly or 
for the wrong reasons. It's too demanding and too distracting. In God's 
economy, we don't have the luxury of pouring ourselves into good things 
when he has so many great things for us. There is simply too much at 
stake.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be this way. Christ-followers 
can be a light in this new world and help make the blogosphere a better 
place. We just need to <strong>open our eyes, look up and smile</strong>.</p>
