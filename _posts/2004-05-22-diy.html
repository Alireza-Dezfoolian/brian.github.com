<p>For those of you reading along who find yourselves thinking, "I could write so much better than this!" (an understandable sentiment), I encourage you to start your own place on the web. A weblog is a great outlet for thoughts and prose, pictures and commentary. I highly recommend the service I use, <a href="http://www.typepad.com">Typepad</a>, but there is a monthly or yearly fee involved, which may be a negative if you're just looking to experiment. In that case, a great choice would be <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a>, which is owned by Google, and is completely free. They just relaunched the site to make it even easier to get started, so give it try! Even if what you write is only of interest to you, it is a worthwhile bit of fun.</p>
