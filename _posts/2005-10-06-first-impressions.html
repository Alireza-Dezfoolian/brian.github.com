<p>You know that moment in a baseball game when the visiting team brings in a relief pitcher? The ballpark announcer dryly states, "Your attention please. Now pitching for the Detroit Tigers, Art Vandelay."</p>

<p>And the hometown fans derisively shout, "Who?"</p>

<p>That's my first reaction to President Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers. In a position of such importance and as a lifetime appointment, I believe the president could have done so much better. I want someone with absolutely unquestionable credentials who is a passionate intellectual force. The debate should be on judicial philosophy, not qualifications. Leading the Texas Lottery Commission does not strike me as a stepping stone to the highest court in the country.</p>

<p>I'm open to being persuaded otherwise, but I wonder if a few days of testimony is enough to adequately make the case on something so critical. </p>
