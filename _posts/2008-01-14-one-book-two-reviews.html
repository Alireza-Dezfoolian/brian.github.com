<p>A fun new thing on <a href="http://www.familyreads.com">Family Reads</a> this morning - <a href="http://www.familyreads.com/2008/01/the-lives-of-ch.html">our first co-review</a>. Lori and Ben read a fantasy book together and decided to both review it for the site. I love seeing the different perspectives.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.familyreads.com/2008/01/the-lives-of-ch.html">Check it out</a>, for no other reason than to see the nearly <a href="http://cuteoverload.com/">Cute Overload</a>-worthy co-review icon Lori created.</p>
