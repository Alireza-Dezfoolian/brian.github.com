<p>Last night was a terrific World Cup qualifying soccer match between the United States and Jamaica. The match ended in a <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/headlinenews?id=307524&cc=5901">1-1 tie</a> following a late U.S. goal. Ben and I had a great time watching it together. As much as we love baseball, in can be jarring to flip from the intensity, volume, and passion of an international soccer match to the prairie calm of an August baseball game.</p>

<p>ESPN has excellent coverage by <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/feature?id=307528&cc=5901">Marc Connolly</a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/feature?id=307527&cc=5901">Jeff Bradley</a>.</p>
