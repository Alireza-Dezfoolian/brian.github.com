<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=3830374" target="_blank">Bloomberg's White House Answers Evolve</a>: ABC News on the possibility of <a href="http://www.mikebloomberg.com" target="_blank">Mayor Mike Bloomberg</a> running for president. </p>

<blockquote>Last week, Bloomberg stopped saying he isn't running, starting with an interview on CNN. He also ducked a request to rule out the possibility, insisting it was the wrong question.

<p>"What you have to ask is why can't we get the candidates that are running and there are plenty declared candidates, both Republican and Democrat why can't they stop this partisan bickering in Washington?" he said. "Why can't they address the issues? Why do we have this continued money-and-influence kind of politics that's wrong?"</blockquote></p>
