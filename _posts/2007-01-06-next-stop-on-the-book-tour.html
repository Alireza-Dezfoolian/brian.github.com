<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">The Blogging Church</a> made the trip from <a href="http://www.perrynoble.com/2006/12/21/awesome-booksand-a-random-thought-or-two/">Perry Noble</a> to Canton, Georgia - the home of the one-and-only Gary Lamb. Gary was kind enough to provide the required picture of him and the book. You'll just have to <a href="http://garylamb.blogspot.com/2007/01/blogging-church.html">see it to believe it</a>.</p>

<p>Here's an excerpt:</p>

<blockquote><p>The book is a easy read and it covers all the bases in regards to blogging and how to do it. It has some great examples of how networking and relationships can happen through blogging. It also gives some great stuff to think about in regards to how churches can better use blogs to communicate to their people. Some of the ideas we will be thinking of using here at The Stone.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>If you are looking for a way to start blogging and want to know how then this book is a must have. If have have the blogging thing figured out, it will still give you some great ideas and also point out some great blogs to you.</p></blockquote>

<p>Read the <a href="http://garylamb.blogspot.com/2007/01/blogging-church.html">full post here</a>, but <a href="http://garylamb.blogspot.com/2007/01/blogging-church-part-2.html">don't miss his follow-up</a> where he talks about how blog can connect people with completely opposite beliefs. <em>Thanks, Gary!</em></p>
