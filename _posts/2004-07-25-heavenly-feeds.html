<p>Looking for daily, Bible RSS feeds delivered straight to your news aggregator? </p>

<p><a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/ibs/dm/index.php">Daily Manna from the Net</a> provides a different NIV verse each day. There is also a collection of <a href="http://www.gnpcb.org/esv/share/rss2.0/">English Standard Version (ESV) feeds</a> that include a daily verse as well as various One Year Bible study versions.</p>

<p>I would love to see King James and The Message versions, as well as more daily devotionals made available, but these sites are a terrific and generous start!</p>
