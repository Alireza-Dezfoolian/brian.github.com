<p>Here's the description from the site:

<p><quote>"Getting organized is easy. Gather your ideas, to-dos, notes, photos, and files online. Set email and mobile reminders so you don't forget the little things. Easily collaborate with others."</quote></p>

<p>The pricing model is also listed (Free, $5, $9, $19/month), but it's not clear yet what you get at each level. Tomorrow should be fun!

<p><em>Simple, focused software that does just what you need and nothing you don't.</em> A terrific mission statement for all software development.

<p><i>Update:</i> <a href="http://www.backpackit.com">Backpack is now live!</a> You can start a page with a to-do list, then add notes, files, and images as the project builds.</p>
