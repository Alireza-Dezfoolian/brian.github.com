<p><a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/maryamie/PersonalSpace.aspx?_c=">Maryamie</a> is one of my favorite new blogs, written by Maryam Scoble, the wife of, well, <a href="http://www.scobleizer.com">you know</a>. Actually, I think Scoble is now introduced as Maryam's husband in most circles, but I'll move on.</p>

<p>Maryam writes a lot of interest things, but I absolutely love her sense of humor. So many of the blogs I read are way too serious. I love things that make me smile and I love things that make me laugh even more - Maryam's blog does both.</p>

<p>So, I sent Maryam a note the other day and mentioned that she would be an ideal person to write <em>The 10 Best Things About Being Married to a Geek</em>. I figured it would be both highly entertaining and something I could share with <a href="http://bailey.typepad.com">my wife</a> on an as needed basis. I'm thrilled to say that she <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/maryamie/Blog/cns!1pJf1AP0KsxqptNL0A6dlsgA!848.entry">posted it tonight</a> and it's absolutely hilarious.</p>

<p>Lori and I read this together and could not stop laughing. My personal favorite is...</p><blockquote><p>No matter how clumsy your sense of style, no matter how awkward your social skills, youâ€™ll be a fashion star and a classy diplomat next to your geek.</p></blockquote><p>By the time you get to the story about computers and Angelina Jolie, you'll have other people asking what's so funny. I hope you enjoy every minute of it.</p>

<p><em>Thanks, Maryam!</em></p>
