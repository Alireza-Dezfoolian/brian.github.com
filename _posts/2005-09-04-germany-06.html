<p>The U.S. men's national team has officially qualified for the <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/">2006 World Cup</a> in Germany! They <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=173300&amp;cc%25&amp;cc=5901">defeated Mexico 2-0</a> last night in a terrific match. DeMarcus Beasley and Kasey Keller turned in dominant performances [read <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=341603&amp;root=us&amp;cc=5901">ESPN's commentary</a>] and now they have nine months to prepare for the biggest event in sports.</p>

<p>Having attended two matches between the U.S. and Mexico (in Houston and Dallas), I only wish I could have been there when the U.S. clinched their 5th consecutive trip to the World Cup.</p>
