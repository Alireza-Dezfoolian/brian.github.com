<p>Our new family project, <strong>Family Reads</strong>, is now live! We launched early this morning. Visit <a target="family reads" href="http://www.familyreads.com">www.familyreads.com</a> to get the scoop.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://brian.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/12/26/promo2_120x240.jpg" title="Family Reads" alt="Promo2_120x240" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" />
What is <strong>Family Reads</strong>? A fun site all about the best books for kids. Lori, Ben and I not only all love books, but we love reading books with each other and sharing them with friends. Finding the best books can be a challenge, though. Lori spends hours upon hours scouring Amazon, book lists, and catalogs to find the&nbsp; truly special ones. It's like living with a children's librarian!</p>

<p>Over the years, we've often bought books for families and friends of Ben, and we inevitably hear, &quot;How did you find this book? I've never heard of it!&quot; or &quot;My daughter doesn't usually like to read, but she <em>loved</em> that book.&quot;</p>

<p>We want to share those books and our love for reading with you, along with many clever ideas to help make reading a quiet refuge in your family's busy life. That's why we started <strong>Family Reads</strong>. </p>

<p>We would also love to include your contributions. We're even supporting a fantastic non-profit through the site. You can find all of the details and much more <a href="http://www.familyreads.com">on the site</a>.</p>

<p>Whenever I think about a blog, I always remember Scoble's idea that the best blogs are <em>passionate</em> and <em>authoritative</em>. We hope <strong>Family Reads</strong> is a fun, helpful destination for you and your family.</p>
