<p>Two quick links from today about the book...</p>

<p>The eminently smart and entertaining <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">Merlin Mann</a> of <strong>43 Folders</strong> <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2007/02/15/your-new-blog/">posted his thoughts</a> after receiving his copy. For what it's worth, 43 Folders is currently the <a href="http://technorati.com/pop/blogs/">85th most popular blog</a> in the world, as measured by Technorati. I'm honored that Merlin was one of the contributors to the book.</p><blockquote><p>I enjoy Brianâ€™s writing and think he has a sound grasp on what makes
blogs work (or not). Good stuff, and red meat for anyone thinking of
taking their church (or their business or their kittens) to the web. <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2007/02/15/your-new-blog/">Link</a></p></blockquote><p>The book is also featured on <a href="http://www.pastorresources.com/review.asp?id=224">PastorResources.com</a>, including an excerpt from the second chapter, <a href="http://www.pastorresources.com/review.asp?id=224">Why Blog?</a></p>
