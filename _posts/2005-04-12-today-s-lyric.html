<p>You've been so kind and generous 
<br />I don't know how you keep on giving 
<br />For your kindness, I'm in debt to you 
<br />For your selflessness, my admiration 
<br />For everything you've done, you know I'm bound<br />I'm bound to thank you for it 

</p>

<p>You've been so kind and generous 
<br />I don't know how you keep on giving 
<br />For your kindness, I'm in debt to you 
<br />And I never could have come, this far without you 
<br />For everything you've done, you know I'm bound 
<br />I'm bound to thank you for it 

</p>

<p>Oh, I want to thank you for so many gifts you gave 
<br />The love, the tenderness, I want to thank you 
<br />I want to thank you for your generosity, the love 
<br />And the honesty that you gave me 
<br />I want to thank you, show my gratitude 
<br />My love, and my respect for you, I want to thank you 
</p>

<p>Oh, I want to thank you, thank you; thank you, thank you<br />I want to thank you, thank you; thank you, thank you</p>

<p>&gt; Natalie Merchant &gt; Kind and Generous &gt; Ophelia</p>
