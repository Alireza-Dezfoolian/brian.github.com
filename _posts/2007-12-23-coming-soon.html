<p>On December 26th, the Bailey's are launching a new project. It's an idea that came to us over six months ago. From the first time the three of us talked about it, we knew we had to do it. We've been working on it on and off ever since and are almost ready to go live. We can't wait to share it with you.</p>

<p>The project has been a huge amount of fun, since it's something we've all been able to work on together. In fact, my 12-year old son, Ben, came up with the name and is doing much of the work. Actually, if I had listened to his advice from the beginning, we most likely would already be live!</p>

<p>So, what is it? I'm sworn to secrecy, but if you read this <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6506781.html?nid=3316">Publishers Weekly article</a>, you'll start to get the idea.</p>

<p>More to come in just 3 days!</p>
