<p>Over the last couple of weeks, I've had the chance to get to know one of people who started Godbit, Nathan Smith. After I somehow managed to <a href="http://godbit.com/article/100th-registered-user">win a couple of books</a> as the 100th forum user, we've started a very enjoyable conversation about web design and the church. Nathan is a great guy; he also has <a href="http://sonspring.com/">a terrific blog</a> that's worth checking out.</p>

<p>Godbit is unique in that it's as passionate about the church as it is about good design. The goal is to encourage churches to build high-quality, accessible sites. Thankfully, the focus is on being helpful, rather than arrogance or relentless criticism.</p>

<p>The church is notoriously behind-the-times when it comes to technology. There are some good reasons (limited budgets, lack of expertise) for this and some not-so-good reasons (low standards and expectations), but the CSS revolution doesn't require more money or bigger servers - it just requires the time and effort to master a core set of skills. Of course, most churches do not have the staff and volunteers needed to make this happen and have to outsource web projects. If outsourcing is the best option for you, limit your search to design companies and freelancers who are committed to standards and accessibility. </p>

<p>Over the past twelve months, we have redesigned three of our sites and are starting to reap incredible benefits from the effort. I promise you that once you get a taste of the new world of web development, you'll never go back.</p>
