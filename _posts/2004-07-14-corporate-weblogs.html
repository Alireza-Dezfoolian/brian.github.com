<p>In the midst of <a href="http://www.scifihifi.com/weblog/life_at_apple/Redmond-Cupertino-Blogs.html">an interesting post</a> on Apple and Microsoft bloggers, I came across a great comment on corporate weblogs.</p>

<p><i>I personally think that every official corporate weblog I’ve ever seen (from Microsoft’s Channel 9 to the Google Blog) has come across as rather contrived and trendy. As <a href="http://www.thecorporation.com/">The Corporation</a> reminds us, corporations may be considered “persons” under the law, but it can be a bit grating watching them try to act the part.</i></p>
