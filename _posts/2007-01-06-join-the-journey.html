<p>I have five galley copies of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">The Blogging Church</a> that I would love to give away. Technically these are the "uncorrected proofs" (the final version is a bit more polished), but they're largely identical. Here's how to get one.</p>

<p>I have one copy for each of five different people - if you match one of these profiles and want one, just post a comment or send me an email with how you qualify and one sentence on why you want a copy. I'll choose the five people Monday night and announce them soon after. No need to provide your address until the chosen few have been chosen. The book comes with just a single, short, string attached - you agree to write a post or Amazon.com review on the book by February 5th. Just share what you think whether you hate it, love it, or anything in-between.</p>

<p>Here are the five people:</p>

<p>1. You have never written a blog post or had a blog of your own<br />
2. You have been blogging for more than a year<br />
3. You are a church planter at a church that is less than a year old<br />
4. You are on staff at a church with more than 2,000 people attending each weekend<br />
5. You are not a Christ-follower or involved at a church, but still want to check it out</p>

<p>The contest begins now!</p>

<p>Just yesterday we got word that the finished book has arrived in the Wiley Publishing warehouse! Copies will start shipping in just two weeks! You can still <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">pre-order from Amazon</a>.</p>
