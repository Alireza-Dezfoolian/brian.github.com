<p>Will Ferrell. Robert Duvall. The movie? <a href="http://www.kickingandscreamingmovie.com/index.php">Kicking and Screaming</a>. Beginning May 13th.</p>

<p>Lori, Ben and I have watched <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/kicking_and_screaming/large_t2.html">the trailer</a> more than once and each time we can't stop laughing. You don't need to have children playing soccer to fully appreciate it, though Ben's soccer season coming to an end this weekend is a terrific coincidence. Any experience with youth sports should guarantee that you see this movie.</p>

<p>Here are just a few of the helpful things I've heard shouted at recent soccer games (I apologize in advance for the exclamation points):</p>

<p>"Run faster!"</p>

<p>"Don't let him get past you!"</p>

<p>"Wake up Stars!" (this was at 8:10am on a Saturday morning)</p>

<p>"You have to kick it where the goalie isn't!"</p>

<p>"Get to the ball before they do!"</p>
