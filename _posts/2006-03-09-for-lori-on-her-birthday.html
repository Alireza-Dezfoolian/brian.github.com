<p>My bride celebrated her birthday yesterday. We've been celebrating birthdays together for quite awhile now. The first was with a card I made her in our junior year of high school! I didn't make the card this year, but there was fun food, great friends, a few gifts, and a performance piece by Ben worthy of an award show opening. Lori deserves this treatment every day - she's simply the best. Seriously, there's been some surveys and studies on this, and she is, verifiably, the best. If you want proof, just check out her <a href="http://bailey.typepad.com/lori/2006/03/when_you_live_i.html">most recent post</a>. </p>

<p>Happy Birthday, Love!</p><blockquote><p>

Wake up to find out <br />

that you are the eyes of the world<br />

but the heart has its beaches<br />

its homeland and thoughts of its own<br />

Wake now, discover that you<br />

are the song that the morning brings<br />

but the heart has its seasons<br />

its evenings and songs of its own<br />- <em>Eyes of the World</em>, Grateful Dead</p></blockquote>
