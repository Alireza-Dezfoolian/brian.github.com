Gowalla, the fantastic startup that has been my home for the past four years, has been acquired by Facebook. <a href="http://blog.gowalla.com/post/13782997303/gowalla-going-to-facebook">Here's the announcement</a>.

My family and I love Austin and our son is fortunate to attend one of the top high schools in the nation, so we're staying put. That also means you can <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/brianbailey">hire me</a>. More on that shortly.

My time at <a href="http://gowalla.com">Gowalla</a> has been incredibly rewarding, both professionally and personally. I was the seventh person to the join the team, working without a desk for the first month in a tiny, two-room office in a Dallas suburb. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/keeg">Keeg</a> had a prime view of the Victoria's Secret window display across the street.

We started with the Facebook game, PackRat, then created Gowalla. After two years, we packed up our houses and families and moved to the wonderful city of Austin. We built pretty amazing things at Gowalla, won some fine awards and accolades, and partnered with brands like Disney, Sundance Film Festival, and National Geographic.

Over these four years, I've worked with some of the most talented and kind individuals I have ever met. I have talked with people around the world who were inspired by Gowalla to explore their cities and share their stories. I got to have tacos with Sean Parker and be part of some fantastic SXSW parties. 

Mostly though, I got to do what I love&mdash;bring order to chaos as a team lead and project manager. Life at a startup is an amazing experience where every day is a new adventure. It's been a chance to learn constantly and to be challenged in ways I never imagined. I loved every minute of it.

Now it's time for something new, and I can't wait to see what the next chapter brings. I believe that our work should change the world for the better. Life is too short to settle for anything else. I'm looking for a focused, passionate team where I can make a significant contribution.

If you see a potential fit for me at your company, let's talk. I'm available for positions in Austin or remote. Connect with me <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/brianbailey">on LinkedIn</a> or <a href="/files/BrianBailey.pdf">download my resume</a>, then <a href="mailto:brianbailey@gmail.com">drop me a note</a>. 

Let's build great things together.
