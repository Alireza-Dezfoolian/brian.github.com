<p>Over the last month, I've grown attached to a couple of fun tools that have made <a href="http://www.bloggingchurch.com">the book process</a> much more enjoyable. </p>

<p>Of course, the first thing we had to do was register the domain name. I used my favorite registrar, <a href="https://www.pairnic.com/main.m">PairNIC</a>. I've used the site a few times in the past and each time I love it more. This company respects you and your time. They make the registration process very simple and you are not flooded with obnoxious up-sells every step of the way. The process is straightforward and I've never had a single issue. Though they are a little more expensive than the the cheapest sites, they are much less than the giants and the overall experience is incomparable.</p>

<p>The second decision was what to use to write the book. So far, my tool of choice is <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/index.shtml">TextWrangler</a> from <a href="http://www.barebones.com/index.shtml">Bare Bones Software</a>. Unbelievably, this wonderful software is free.</p>

<p>The interface is incredibly minimal and just stays out of your way. The software has a number of powerful features, but the two things that bring me constant joy is working with multiple files at once (i.e. Chapter One, Chapter Two, etc...) and the awesome APPLE-I combination which gives you instant access to your document's info (i.e. the almighty word count). I absolutely love this software, and it's great for the times when I mess with code as well (including built-in support for SFTP).</p>

<p>The third decision was how to manage all of these different blogs. I'm now posting regularly to 5 different blogs, most of which are separate TypePad accounts. Enter <a href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> from Ranchero, the makers of the world's best newsreader, <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a>.</p>

<p>This tool allows you to easily write and publish to multiple blogs. It also has a number of great features that make it so much better than using a browser, including spell checking as you type, cool cut-n-paste link inserting, easy drafts, and word count. Plus, you don't have to be online to use it.</p>

<p>Both TextWrangler and MarsEdit are only available for the Macintosh. Give these tools a try and let me know what you think.</p>
