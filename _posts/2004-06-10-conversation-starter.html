<p>After <a href="http://scoblecomments.scripting.com/comments?u=1011&p=7715&link=http%3A%2F%2Fradio.weblogs.com%2F0001011%2F2004%2F06%2F07.html%23a7715">Scoble's recent suggestion</a>, I have decided to enable comments on this site.</p>

<blockquote>I wish your blog had comments. Lots of people love discussing religion, and I can't think of a better place to discuss it than on your blog.</blockquote>

<p>Hopefully, we can start an interesting conversation here. I look forward to hearing thoughts and ideas, questions and answers, and a bits and pieces of anything else. My hope and expectation is that we can be respectful, kind and fair in the process.</p>

<p>Happy commenting!</p>
