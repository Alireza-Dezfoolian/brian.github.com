<p>As the weblog buzz grows, more and more people are starting blogs. Most people want to start with a free blog as a low-risk experiment - which normally means Google's <a href="http://www.blogger.com/start">Blogger</a>. There are a few great alternatives, though, particularly Microsoft's <a href="http://www.msnspaces.com/Default.aspx">MSN Spaces</a>.</p>

<p>The <em>Wall Street Journal's</em> Walter Mossberg <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/0,,SB111878431732959531-Hc5m3ctbnR1Dnv4yoCiNZq71qFc_20060614,00.html?mod=public_home_us">recently compared</a> the various alternatives and chose MSN Spaces as the best, easiest choice. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/0,,SB111878431732959531-Hc5m3ctbnR1Dnv4yoCiNZq71qFc_20060614,00.html?mod=public_home_us">His article</a> is definitely worth checking out if you're about to make the leap!</p>

<p><em>One warning</em>: starting with a free site makes perfect sense, but if you do choose to move your blog to another service down the road, the transition can be painful.</p>
