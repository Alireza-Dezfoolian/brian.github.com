<p>The transition to the new site for <a target="amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/0787984876&amp;tag=leaveitbehind-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">The Blogging Church</a> is nearly complete! If the result looks suspiciously like LeaveItBehind.com, that's because it is exactly that.</p>

<p>The site for <a target="amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/0787984876&amp;tag=leaveitbehind-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">The Blogging Church</a> and my blog have merged to become a powerful new conglomerate offering incredible synergy for each of its formerly divergent, market-leading ventures! </p>

<p>"So basically, there were two sites before and now there's one?"</p>

<p>Well, yeah, that about sums it up.</p>

<p>The book blog has been archived and all of that content is <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/book">still available here</a>, along with <a href="http://www.terrystorch.com">Terry's</a> great <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/book/podcast/index.html">podcasts</a>. I've added links to the BloggingChurch.com content on the sidebar of this site, including the most recent additions, <a href="http://brianbailey.backpackit.com/pub/784928">What People Are Saying</a> and the list of <a href="http://brianbailey.backpackit.com/pub/784948">Blogging Pastors and Churches</a>.</p>

<p>One site and <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/LeaveItBehind">one feed</a> for updates on the book, thoughts on blogging in the church, and an eclectic collection of bonus content. Terry and I are working on some fun ideas for the book as it nears publication and a few more improvements are coming to this site. So make yourselves at home, say hello to the people around you, and join the conversation when you have something to say!</p>

<p>For those of you who have been kind enough to promote <em>The Blogging Church</em> on your sites through slick marketing graphics, thank you! The images and links still work perfectly well. Look for a fresh set of graphics and site badges in the near future.</p>
