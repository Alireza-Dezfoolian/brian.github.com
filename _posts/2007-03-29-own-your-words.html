<p>So much anger and hatred has been brought to the surface this week online, and the story is <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=business&amp;id=5165663">likely to grow</a> as the media grabs hold of something they've wanted to write for a long time. As blogging has continued to grow and thrive and be adopted by prominent people and organizations, the stories about it being an outlet for irrelevant writing by people with way too much time on their hands (i.e. irrelevant <em>people</em>) have grown increasingly absurd. Unfortunately, they now have a new angle that they know how to use more effectively than any other: fear.</p>

<p>Of course, we've brought this on ourselves. We let the party get out of hand, we ignored what was going on in the basement, and now the cops have been called, the sun is coming up, and our gut says that something went wrong.</p>

<p>My view isn't that more should be done to control those (thankfully) few who have a desperate desire to let out the darkness that's inside them, even if it's with a smirk. As I said before, they will always find an outlet and if their words don't violate the law they have a right to publish them. </p>

<p>Our job is to make it clear that such behavior isn't allowed on our own, virtual property. We must take responsibility for the place we call home. Imagine if someone stuck a yard sign filled with hateful or racist words in my front lawn and I said, &quot;Well, they have a right to say what they want.&quot; </p>

<p>If I leave those words in my lawn, I take responsibility for them, and eventually, they belong to me.</p>
