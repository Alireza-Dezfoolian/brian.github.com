<p><a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a> from <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37Signals</a> in Chicago, is simply a fantastic piece of software. Offered as an inexpensive hosted web application, Basecamp allows you to manage multiple projects within your browser. You can share files, calendar and communication with team members from a single location.</p>

<p>At Fellowship, our communications/graphics team uses Basecamp to track hundreds of projects. Each designer can view his or her task list and continually update each project. You can also provide access to contractors and vendors. The project manager can then view a high level status report of open work. If you want to take it to an even higher level, you can subscribe to a RSS feed to track updates to your projects.</p>

<p>Basecamp is simple and intuitive to use. 37Signals spends a great deal of time and energy on making elegant software, software that does what it needs to do and no more. But one fact stands above all others:</p>

<p><b>Basecamp gets used.</b></p>

<p>How often do you purchase and install software, set it in front of your users, and sit back and watch it gather dust? Basecamp is the exact opposite. From the first day, our use has continued to grow and expand into new areas. </p>

<p>37Signals makes it easy to give Basecamp a try. Take a few minutes to discover what you're missing.<br />
