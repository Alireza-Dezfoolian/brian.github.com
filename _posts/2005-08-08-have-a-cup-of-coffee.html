<p>Since we started the redesign of our websites, we've begun to put together a core set of web development principles to guide us. This isn't a new methodology, but a way of looking at each project and each problem. What these principles allow us to do is take a hard look at our <em>solution</em> and determine if it is truly the best one. </p>

<p>Two recent decisions can serve as good examples. During the past four months, we faced two missing pieces - an e-commerce solution and a content management solution. We experimented with a number of open source packages, we sought advice and asked questions, we researched extensively, and built basic prototypes. In the end, we decided to customize an existing e-commerce solution (<a href="http://www.zen-cart.com/modules/frontpage/">Zen Cart</a>) and build our own content management system. Each problem demands a unique solution, one that meets its specific challenges.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">Introducing <strong>COFFEE</strong></span></p>

<p>We call our set of principles COFFEE development. What does COFFEE stand for?</p>

<p>We want everything we do to reflect these principles. Of course, the first priority of our group or any web team within an organization, is to be in-line with the vision and mission of Fellowship Church. This isn't our own mission statement; COFFEE development is what we use to help us share the mission and vision of Fellowship on the web.</p>

<p>What do each of these mean? Every day this week I'll tackle one of these pieces and explain what it means to us and how we work to implement it. I know this will help me and my team flesh out our development approach and I hope it will benefit others as well. So, come back tomorrow with the venti of your choice and we'll see what <strong>Cheap</strong> web development looks like.</p>
