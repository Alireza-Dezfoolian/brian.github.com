<p><a href="http://www.mint.com">Mint.com</a> appears to live up to the hype. It's a very elegant personal finance site that allows you to group all of your transactions in one place. You can setup a budget, then compare to your latest numbers, all in a beautiful web app. Unfortunately, you can only import from banks and credit card companies - brokerage houses such as Fidelity and Charles Schwab are not yet supported. Unfortunately, this means my planned Mint migration is on hold for the foreseeable future. If you're not tied to a brokerage company for the majority of your banking, though, I would definitely give Mint a try.</p>
