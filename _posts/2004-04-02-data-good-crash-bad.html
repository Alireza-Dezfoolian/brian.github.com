<p>Yesterday had the potential to be one of my more disastrous April Fool's Days. In the process of moving all of my work and personal files to my new Dell desktop, the hard drive crashed. For nearly 2 hours I was left to ponder my shocking series of bad decisions that led me to no longer have any backup of these files; not on CD, not on the original machine, and not on the network. Praise God the machine came to life just long enough for me to retrieve 98% of my past, leaving me shaken and thankful, and a 100x more cautious!</p>

<p>This is the second time in 3 months a Dell machines has arrived and failed within the first 24 hours. Why is it that these incidents don't receive more press?</p>
