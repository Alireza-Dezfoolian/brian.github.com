<p>Jason Fried's presentation from SXSW is now available online: <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/2005/03/sxsw_2005_prese.php">How to Make Big Things Happen with Small Teams</a>. Jason is the new <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel</a>. Since he has been the highlight of SXSW for two years in a row, I'm thinking of just attending the next <a href="http://www.37signals.com/workshop-basecamp.php">Building of Basecamp Workshop</a> with the <a href="http://www.37signals.com">37Signals</a> team instead.</p>

<p>We raved about <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a> at our church conference in January and just noticed that another large church is <a href="http://jpowell.blogs.com/jason_powell_church_it/2005/03/online_project_.html">getting on board</a>. Where's an affiliate program when you need one?</p>
