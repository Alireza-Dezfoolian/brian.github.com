<p>I leave for <a href="http://2005.sxsw.com/interactive/">SXSW in Austin</a> today. Terry has already <a href="http://www.terrystorch.com/2005/03/off_to_sxsw.html">posted his itenerary</a>. </p>

<p>SXSW is one of the best conference bargains you will find. Even if you register at the door, the Interactive Conference price is $250 for <strong>four days</strong> of sessions and keynotes. Since we are blessed to be a short 3.5 hour drive away, we also save on air fare and a rental car. And SXSW isn't just any conference. Here's how <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,66828,00.html">Wired described it today</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Austin is the place for Netheads. South by Southwest Interactive has morphed into one of the most popular gatherings of those who create internet culture. This year, the buzz at the conference is the growing acceptance and importance of bloggers in the mainstream.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm greating looking forward to hearing <a href="http://2005.sxsw.com/interactive/conference/panels/?action=show&amp;id=IAP0004">Jeffrey Zeldman</a>, <a href="http://2005.sxsw.com/interactive/conference/panels/?action=show&amp;id=IAP0039">Daniel Pink</a>, <a href="http://2005.sxsw.com/interactive/conference/panels/?action=show&amp;id=IAP0077">Malcolm Gladwell</a>, <a href="http://2005.sxsw.com/interactive/conference/panels/?action=show&amp;id=IAP0011">Jason Fried</a>, <a href="http://2005.sxsw.com/interactive/conference/panels/?action=show&amp;id=IAP0082">Dan Gillmor</a>, and, of course, the <a href="http://2005.sxsw.com/interactive/conference/panels/?action=show&amp;id=IAP0063">Homestar Runner guys</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://2005.sxsw.com/interactive/conference/panels/?action=show&amp;id=IAP0087">How to Build Your Brand with Blogs</a> session should be terrific, with Jason Fried, Molly Holzschlag, and Mr. Robert Scoble himself.</p>

<p>In the interest of full disclosure, I am indeed <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/03/07.html#a9559">sharing a room with Scoble</a>, but I can assure my loyal readers that this will in no way affect my journalistic integrity. I was not offered any Microsoft <a href="http://www.answers.com/tchotchkes&amp;r=67">tchotchkes</a>, increased <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GoogleJuice">Google juice</a>, a prominent place on his blogroll, or any fixed number of blog links. And for the record, this is in no way part of plan to share hotel rooms with <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6693381/site/newsweek/">a-list bloggers</a> in general.<br />&nbsp; </p>
