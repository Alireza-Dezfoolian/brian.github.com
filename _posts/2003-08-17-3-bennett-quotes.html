<p>3 great Bennett quotes from the past week:Â </p>

<p>1. The family was joking about what each of one of our favorite sounds was. I mentioned "You've got mail!" simply as a joke as I haven't used AOL since, well, ever. But Ben still didn't miss a beat; "You mean, You've got &lt;em&gt;checkin error &lt;/em&gt;mail?" This refers to my rather obsessive email checking on the weekend, looking to see how many application errors we've received during the services at church. He's way too clever for his own good!</p>

<p>2. Which leads to the second comment. Today, while he was being particularly goofy, I said, "You're so weird." He replied, "So, all smart kids are weird." He disclaimed any knowledge of where he learned that piece of information.</p>

<p>3. And lastly, on Friday night we watched <a href="http://www.creativeconnection.org">Creative Connection</a>. It is the television show of our pastor, Ed Young, and we are rarely able to watch it as we're often gone on Friday nights. The show featured a sermon from a couple of years ago and Ben was having a great time watching it, as he is never in the main service. At one point, Ed said, "After all, what do you have that didn't come from God?" and from the other side of the couch, I hear Ben say, "Nothing." Lori and I were dumbfounded.</p>

<p>Smart, funny, and a keen understanding of cosmic truth. What more could you ask for?</p>
