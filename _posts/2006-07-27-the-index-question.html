<p>One of the questions about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/0787984876&amp;tag=leaveitbehind-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">The Blogging Church</a> that needs to be answered this week is whether it should have an index. Most of you are avid readers and more than a few have written books yourselves. Do you have an opinion on this one?</p>

<p>My instinct is to not have one. There is a small expense involved (it is usually created by a professional), but the main reasons are: I rarely use an index, the chapters are very specific and self-contained, and I've read a number of non-fiction books recently that didn't have one. </p>

<p>On the other hand, an index is still quite common and I assume many people rely on it. </p>

<p>Here's your chance to be heard! What do you think? Yes or no?</p>
