<p>One of the many privileges I have as a father is reading with Ben. We started reading chapter books together when he was three and despite growing into a voracious reader, he still lets me read to him at nearly 10. At every moment, Ben is in the middle of three books - one alone, one with Lori, and one with me. We've now read over 75 chapter books together (yes, we're <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/01/list_not_want_n.html">list people</a>) and I thought today would be the perfect day to post my favorites. I will be forced to cheat a bit by counting a few series only once.</p>
