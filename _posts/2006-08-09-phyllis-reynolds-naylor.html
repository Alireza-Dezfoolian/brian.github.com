<p>One of our family's favorite authors is Phyllis Reynolds Naylor. She primarily writes for young adults. She has written over 150 books, including many classic series such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0689015259/sr=1-3/qid=1155180248/ref=pd_bbs_3/002-6472235-1816849?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">Shiloh</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0689865554/ref=pd_sim_b_2/002-6472235-1816849?ie=UTF8">The Cat Pack</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0440416752/ref=pd_sim_b_1/002-6472235-1816849?ie=UTF8">The Boys Versus the Girls</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0689813376/sr=1-2/qid=1155180337/ref=sr_1_2/002-6472235-1816849?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">The Besseldorf Hotel</a>, and more. Ben and I have read over 20 of her books together and sharing the Shiloh and Cat Pack books in particular will always be some of my favorite times with him. </p>

<p>If you have children between 7-10, find the letter N in the juvenile fiction area of your library and you'll come home with a bag full of humor, warmth, and timeless lessons.</p>

<p>When Ben was younger, he and I wrote a letter to Mrs. Naylor, including some drawings he had done of Marco and Polo, the feline stars of the Cat Pack books. Less than a month later we received a handwritten note that was incredibly sweet and thoughtful. She even mentioned that the pictures were hanging on her wall. If we weren't smitten before, we were then!</p>

<p>Another interesting fact is that Mrs. Naylor was born in Anderson, Indiana, where both of my parents spent parts of their childhood and later went to college. I, too, attended <a href="http://www.anderson.edu/">Anderson University</a> during my freshman year. She returned to speak at the school a couple of years ago, which I was sad to miss.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I discovered that Mrs. Naylor has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/blog/id/A2IB8Y030T1JW/ref=cm_blog_blog/102-6074644-8522500">an author's blog on Amazon</a>. She's posting quite regularly and I absolutely love to read her thoughts. There is something so peaceful in her reflections, whether about growing up, her inspiration for writing, or just today, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/plog/post.html/ref=cm_blog_pl/102-6074644-8522500?ie=UTF8&amp;pt=personalBlog&amp;aid=PlogMyCustomersAgent&amp;ot=customer&amp;pd=1155158428.547&amp;pid=PMCA2IB8Y030T1JWat1155153167&amp;iid=A2IB8Y030T1JW">the importance of porches</a>. I'm so glad she's decided to share her thoughts in this new way. </p>
