<p>I had hopes of writing a sweet and witty recap of our family's Halloween celebration. This eloquent post would include awww-inspiring photos of my cute boy in his skeleton costume, as well as our visiting princess.</p>

<p>Instead, I get to do something even better...link to my <a href="http://bailey.typepad.com/lori/2004/11/halloween_sweet.html">wife Lori's post</a> on the event! If you haven't come across her recently started blog yet, take a few minutes to <a href="http://bailey.typepad.com/lori">stop by</a>. I do this with the full knowledge that you'll quickly discover that you've been reading the <em>second-best</em> writer in the Bailey family. Lori's writing is warm and inviting, heartfelt and clever, and a pure pleasure to read. <em>Enjoy!</em></p>
