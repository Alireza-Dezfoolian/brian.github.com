<p>There are blogging churches and blogging pastors, but precious few <strong>blogging preachers.</strong> If you haven't experienced a blogging preacher, you might as well start with the best.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.perrynoble.com/">Perry Noble</a> of New Spring Community Church.</p>

<p>I'm not talking about publishing last week's sermon transcript. I'm talking about the real deal - passion, humor, personality, humility, and Truth delivered in a I-couldn't-stop-reading-this-if-I-tried way.</p>

<p>Check out this post: <a href="http://perrynoble.blogspot.com/2005_09_01_perrynoble_archive.html#112791218711862489">Date Night</a>.</p>

<p><blockquote>Some men I see on date night are pathetic...they have their cell phone, blackberry, their PDA--they don't look like a husband--they look like Batman!!! Quit playing the super hero role, leave the office and spend time with your wife.</blockquote></p>

<p>And that's just the beginning. Perry spoke at Fellowship Church a year ago and we can't say enough about him and his <a href="http://www.newspring.cc/community/">awesome church</a>. </p>

<p>You can't read his blog without getting a true sense of his heart, his energy, and his church. His blog is a terrific example of what can happen when a pastor puts it all out there in an open and honest way.</p>
