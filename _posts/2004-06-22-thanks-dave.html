<p>In the too-little-too-late category, following the <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,63953,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_5">recent firestorm</a> over the weblogs.com retirement, I want to thank <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Dave</a> for hosting my first weblog for over two years at no charge. As I said in <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2004/04/begin_again.html">my first post</a> on this site, I owe Dave a great deal, both for introducing me to weblogs, as well as the joys and challenges of writing in public.</p>

<p>I used my Manila site on weblogs.com as a personal journal, posting a daily commentary each and every night for over a year. It was my first experience with daily writing and whenever I've returned to what I wrote, I've been so glad I had the opportunity to experiment.</p>

<p>When the controversy first broke, I thought I was one of the good guys because I didn't need any help and I wasn't one of the people contributing to the storm. Oddly enough, our church talked about this very subject recently (well, not how weblogs.com is no longer hosting weblogs). In talking about loyalty and friendship, our pastor talked about how staying silent while a friend is criticized is being complicit in the attack. It wasn't until this experience that it became clear to me.</p>

<p>I retired and exported the site long ago, so I don't need any assistance, but that was a generous thing Dave did, for me and the then-fledgling weblog community, and he has my gratitude and best wishes for it.</p>
