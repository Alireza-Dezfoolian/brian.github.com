<p>I was going through <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/top_10_lists/">Top 10 List</a> withdrawal and so I thought of a little experiment. What if I could only subscribe to 10 blogs? Which ones would I choose? What are the 10 blogs I simply can't do without? I thought I'd post my list and then add it to the sidebar for everyone to enjoy.</p>

<p>And then a funny thing happened. I only came up with 8. Now, I read a lot of great blogs, but when forced to choose blogs than I check even if all I have is a web browser, blogs that I truly consider essential, I fell short. </p>

<p>So, that's where you can help. What blogs do you find it hard to go without? Which ones do you check even when you're on vacation? What's the best blog I'm <em>not</em> reading?</p>
