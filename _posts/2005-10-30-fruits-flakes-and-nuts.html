I had my first taste last week and now I'm addicted (yes, I really was volunteering). If you haven't tried any of the healthy snacks from <a href="http://www.mrsmays.com/">Mrs. May's Naturals</a>, head out to your nearest Target, Sam's Club, or health food store and give them a try. They are not only fantastic, but about as pure and healthy as you can find on a grocery store shelf. </p>

<p>Mrs. May's offers a long list of seed and nut based options, including Black Sesame, Pumpkin, and Sunflower. Here's what the site has to say: <em>All Mrs. May's products are vegan, non-GMO, cholesterol&nbsp; free, dairy free, wheat free, gluten free, and contain no artificial colors or flavors. And our ingredients lists are short and sweet!</em></p>

<p>Now I have to find someplace that sells them in bulk or start volunteering a lot more!</p>

<p>And since a lot of people read this site and have absolutely no interest in my snack recommendations, Mrs. May's also has a website worth looking at - I especially like <a href="http://www.mrsmays.com/view_detail.asp?indx=1010">their product pages</a>.</p>
