<p>37signals is running <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/37signals_coupon_codes.php">a rare promotion</a>. For a limited time, you can upgrade from a free <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a>, <a href="http://backpackit.com/?referrer=BPZZS">Backpack</a>, or <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a> account and receive a $5 or $10 discount on your first month. Basecamp is an amazing project management tool that just keeps getting better. We've also made great use of Campfire chats recently and most of you are tired of hearing me rave about Backpack. </p>

<p>All I'll say about it is that in the last 30 days, I've used Backpack to write a book, launch a website, plan a vacation, and remind me to get the oil changed on our cars. It's a wonderful, simple place to collect the many hundreds of ideas and pieces of information that pass through your mind each day. Plus, you can share these pages with as many people as you want.</p>

<p>If you're interested in giving the paid version a try, <a href="http://backpackit.com/?referrer=BPZZS">now is the time</a>! </p>
