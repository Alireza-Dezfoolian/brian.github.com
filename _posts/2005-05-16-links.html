<p><a href="http://www.churchmarketingsucks.com">Church Marketing Sucks</a> (well worth adding to your favorite newsreader) had some <a href="http://www.churchmarketingsucks.com/archives/2005/05/church_blogging.html">nice things to say</a> about my interview with Shel Israel and Robert Scoble for their recently named book project, <em><a href="http://www.nakedconversations.com">Naked Conversations</a>: How Blogs are Changing the Way Businesses Talk with Customers.</em> <a href="http://www.churchmarketingsucks.com/archives/2005/05/evangelism_it_l.html">In another post</a>, they discuss Scoble's original visit to Fellowship.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.churchmarketingsucks.com/archives/2005/05/businessweek_go.html">they link</a> to Business Week's recent cover story on mega-churches: <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_21/b3934001_mz001.htm">Earthly Empires</a>. The article covers fairly standard territory, but does included some interesting numbers.</p>
