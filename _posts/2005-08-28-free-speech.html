<p>Read this <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/08/28.html#a10983">awesome Scoble rant</a> on free speech. The beauty of weblogs is that every person can add her own voice to the conversation. After a few people link to you and start talking about what you're saying, whether they agree or not, you'll soon show up in the search engines next to sites with thousands of readers. <em>Want free speech?

<p>If this was a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058808/">Green Acres</a> episode, there would have definitely been a fife in the background. You can tell Scoble spent some time in the church because the man can preach when he wants to!</p>
