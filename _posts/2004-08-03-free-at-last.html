<p>Despite working on four different websites, that in some cases require or strongly encourage registration in order to reach certain areas, I am not unlike most web users in being frustrated by site roadblocks that prevent me from accessing a free article or other content on a one-time basis. Well, the solution is here.</p>

<p>If you haven't tried <a href="http://www.bugmenot.com">BugMeNot.com</a>, you have to give it a try. You simply type in a URL and they provide you with a generic login and password you can use to access a site. I had the opportunity to use it today and was able to read an article without inviting another round of spam into my inbox. <i>Very cool!</i></p>
