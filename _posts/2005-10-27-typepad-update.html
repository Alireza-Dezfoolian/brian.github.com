<p>Quick follow-up on my post on <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/10/double_double_t.html">TypePad performance problems</a>. First, a TypePad employee was kind enough to <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/10/double_double_t.html#comments">comment on the post</a>, asking for patience and apologizing for the problems. <em>Much appreciated!</em></p>

<p>Second, Mena Trott <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/about/corner/2005/10/the_ups_downs_o.html">posted a response from Ben</a> on her blog. Ben walks us through the problems and how they have developed over the past month. It's a familiar technology tale - a datacenter move accompanied by new hardware to keep up with fast-paced growth. Unexpected problems arise that suddenly snowball in completely non-sensical ways. You know you're in the middle of one of these trials when you start using phrases like, &quot;We've never had a problem with that server&quot; or &quot;Why would that fail now?&quot;</p>

<p>Ben admits they should have been more public about the problems and provided details and updates sooner. Technology people are so passionate about solving problems, and so optimistic about a solution being within reach, that it's very hard to stop to communicate during what seems like a never-ending emergency. Having been in similar situations (not in scale, of course), they have my sympathy.</p>

<p>I hope they continue to make progress and start providing ongoing updates and behind-the-scenes details. The more information you provide, the more your customers feel like it's a shared struggle, offering assistance and cheering your victories. It's a lesson even a company built on blogs has to learn.</p>
