<p>I love online recommendation systems. When I recently added <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/">Dr. Strangelove</a> to my Blockbuster queue, the site was kind enough to recommend <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109370/">Canadian Bacon</a> for my viewing pleasure. While allowing for some thematic similarities, it's a bit like saying, "You choose this vintage Italian red wine. You might also a grape juice box!" </p>
