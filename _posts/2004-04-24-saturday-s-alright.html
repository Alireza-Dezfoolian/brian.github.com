<p>The rain from the night before lasted throughout Saturday, giving us a very quiet day at home. Ben's baseball game was cancelled, so church was our only excuse to leave the house. Ben played numerous games of MLB Showdown (I joined in for one), we watched the Rangers, and Lori and I caught up on our sitcoms from the week.</p>
