<p>The third element of <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/08/have_a_cup_of_c.html">COFFEE Development</a> is <strong>Fast</strong>. You may assume that I am referring to the speed of development, but as we build our sites, the primary focus is on the <em>speed of the pages</em>. We want sites that are as lean as possible and we go to great lengths to strip every last ounce of fat.</p>

<p>Why? It's all about the user experience. We all know what a pleasure it is to use a fast, responsive site. In this age of ever-increasing bandwidth, obsessing over 20-30K can seem like overkill, but I regularly experience painful site delays even behind our multi-T1 connection. We want our sites to be <em>usable</em> over dial-up. If that makes them absolutely scream on a modern broadband connection, all the better.</p>

<p>On our two new sites, we have reduced many pages by 50% or more, by optimizing and/or limiting graphics, writing clean code, and using various compression techniques.</p>

<p>It is rare in web design that the goal is to visually amaze the user. The goal above all else is for the site to <strong>serve the user</strong>, by helping them get what they want as quickly and easily as possible. They will remember that experience long after the browser art and splash pages have disappeared.</p>
