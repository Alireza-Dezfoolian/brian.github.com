<p>Here's a random thought that came to mind today. One of my favorite, classic moments from the 1980's occurred in a quintessential suburban mall. It was 1985, during the height of the Mozart craze, brought on by the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086879/">Amadeus</a>. As I was walking through the mall, I passed a music stand packed with cassette tapes (hey, it was <em>1985</em>). Since the mall was the main place to buy music back then (at least for someone without a driver's license), I started browsing through the racks. The soundtrack for Amadeus caught my eye and I picked up a copy to look at it. </p>

<p>That's when I saw a piece of cardboard taped underneath the stack of Amadeus tapes. The cardboard had an emphatic message written on it with a black sharpie (what am I thinking...sharpies <em>only</em> came in black in 1985). You could sense the clerks frustration in the violent way the note was written. Clearly, this was the answer to a question he or she had faced again and again, day after day. A question that, for me, sums up the 80's, even to this day.</p>

<p>The message read...</p>

<p>If you somehow missed the cultural phenomenon that was Falco's <em>Rock Me Amadeus</em>, <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;token=&amp;sql=33:4yd6vbmya9tk">AllMusic.com has a terrific summation</a>:</p><blockquote><p>It may well be the single worst pop song recorded in the entire decade
of the 1980s, but there's something so wackily endearing about the
utter lack of self-consciousness on display here that it's finally
impossible to truly hate it.</p></blockquote>
