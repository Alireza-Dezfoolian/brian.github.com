<p>Next week is going to be packed from beginning to end with some very cool stuff. Here's a preview...</p>

<p><strong>One</strong></p>
<p>Ed Young and the Fellowship Church staff are taking the <a href="http://www.fellowshipconnection.com/c3regional05nv/index.php">Creative Church Conference</a> on the road to Las Vegas. The one-day conference kicks off Monday morning.</p>

<p><strong>Two</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.creativepastors.com/splash.phtml">CreativePastors</a> team will be in Atlanta for the <a href="http://www.catalystconference.com/">Catalyst Conference</a> Thursday and Friday. They have some <strong>free stuff</strong> for you whether you're going or not. Find out more on the <a href="http://cp.blogs.com/cp/2005/09/the_sounds_of_s.html">CP Blog</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Three</strong></p>
<p>We hope to have the brand-new look for <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com/fcweb/home.aspx">FellowshipChurch.com</a> approved by the end of the week. We can't wait to get started on the redesign. Want a hint? Think of all the church websites you've ever seen? Got it? </p>

<p>Now think of the opposite. Yes, it's that different.</p>

<p><strong>Four</strong></p>
<p>On Wednesday, Fellowship Grapevine will have our first <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com/FCWeb/music/firstwednesday.aspx">Emergent Service</a>, an evening of worship, prayer, and communion.</p>

<p><strong>Five</strong></p>
<p>This weekend, we're debuting a brand-new Flash streaming solution on <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com/fcweb/home.aspx">FellowshipChurch.com</a>. If you have cable, fiber, or a great connection at the office, prepare to be blown away. I haven't seen anything like it on the web.</p>

<p>If you have DSL, satellite, or even dial-up, we finally have something for you as well. If all goes well, we'll post the details on our <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/code/">Code site</a> next week. If it doesn't, you'll be the 3,474th person to know.</p>

<p><strong>Six</strong></p>
<p>And, as Steve Job would say, there's one more thing...</p>

<p>Ed Young. <a href="http://cp.blogs.com/cp/2005/09/the_sounds_of_s.html">Podcast</a>.</p>

<p>There's a lot of fun things ahead!</p>
