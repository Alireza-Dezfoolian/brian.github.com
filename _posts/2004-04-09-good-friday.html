<p>Today began the first of 9 identical Easter services at <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com">Fellowship</a>. It should be an incredible weekend.</p>

<p>Even after working at a church for nearly 4 years, I still find it strange that the holidays for most everyone are, for us, the church-equivalent of the day-after-Thanksgiving sales for the retail world. I always have to remind myself that there is little reason to ask a church employee what their plans are for Easter or Christmas, for the plan is always the same; to retreat into a sleep-filled coma on Sunday afternoon following 9 or more services. And unlike nearly every other profession, the weekend after is just as important, if not more. I think most church leaders would say that it isn't terribly difficult to get people to attend during Easter and Christmas. The true challenge is to get people to come back the next weekend.</p>
