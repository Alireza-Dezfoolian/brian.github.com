<p>Mark Bernstein <a href="http://markbernstein.org/Jun0501.html#note_36286">quietly announced</a> last week that the next version of <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> will support OPML!</p>

<p>This is great news. <a href="http://www.opml.org/">OPML</a> is a format for sharing outlines than is increasingly becoming a standard. In fact, there's a new <a href="http://support.opml.org/">OPML editor</a> being developed right now that is getting quite a lot of attention. Being able to swap lists, blogrolls, and directories from one application to another is very handy. I look forward to Tinderbox's implementation.</p>
