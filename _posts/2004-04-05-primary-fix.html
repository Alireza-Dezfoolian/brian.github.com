<p>Though we're now well into the general election, here's a political observation from the primaries. Every presidential season begins with the pilgrimage to Iowa and New Hampshire. As we all know, this produces innumerable town meetings and debates dominated by talk of farms and agricultural subsidies (Iowa) and manufacturing (New Hampshire). Obviously, the internet economy plays a role in every state, but it became clear this year during the Democratic primaries how beneficial it would be to add a state dominated by the internet economy to the early slate of primaries and caucuses, in order to assure that internet issues are addressed.</p>
