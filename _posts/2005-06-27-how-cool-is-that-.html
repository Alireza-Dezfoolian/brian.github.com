<p>Lori and Ben got me some wonderful presents for Father's Day, including a new bike seat, cool clothes (Ben picked out a weekend shirt for me all by himself), and fun food. But the gift that dominated my weekend was truly brilliant - an <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore?family=iTMSCardsCertificates">iTunes gift card</a>!</p>

<p>I can't recommend this enough for nearly any special occasion. It is so much fun to pick and choose your favorite songs and build your very own album for free. If the receiver is not schooled in technology, you can offer to burn a CD from his or her selections.</p>

<p>My favorite finds from the past? </p>

I just discovered the next best thing - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00006LHWO/ref=wl_it_dp/102-3137039-4580935?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;coliid=I335AB5QZS877E&amp;v=glance&amp;colid=V9GRC9TVYH6L">Phish did</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=BhVzT*D2F0k&amp;offerid=78941.450154512&amp;type=10&amp;subid=">Head Over Heels</a> by the Go-Go's &gt; one of the happiest songs ever.</p>

<p><a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=BhVzT*D2F0k&amp;offerid=78941.450154614&amp;type=10&amp;subid=">I Feel So Good</a> and <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=BhVzT*D2F0k&amp;offerid=78941.450154615&amp;type=10&amp;subid=">Read About Love</a> by Richard Thompson &gt; from our days in Chicago.</p>

<p><a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=BhVzT*D2F0k&amp;offerid=78941.362727826&amp;type=10&amp;subid=">Hallelujah</a> by Jeff Buckley &gt; a great interpretation of a Leonard Cohen classic.</p>

<p><a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=BhVzT*D2F0k&amp;offerid=78941.450154620&amp;type=10&amp;subid=">Masters of War</a> by Pearl Jam &gt; Eddie sings Dylan.</p>

<p>As much as I love these songs, though, the experience all came down to a single song I have wanted for years. One of the best songs of the 90's can at last be purchased on iTunes...</p>

<p>Thanks to the <em>Ladder 49</em> Soundtrack, this song is finally available. I have already listened to it about 20 times and it's one of those few songs that is actually better than I remember it. I guarantee you that it is worth $0.99!</p>
