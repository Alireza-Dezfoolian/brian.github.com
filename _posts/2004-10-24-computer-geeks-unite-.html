<p>Robert Scoble visited the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org">Computer History Museum</a> in Silicon Valley <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/10/18.html#a8428">with his son recently</a>. What could be more fun than that? Ben and I need to make our way to California and visit the museum and <a href="http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/sf/ballpark/sf_ballpark_history.jsp">Pac Bell Park</a>.</p>

<p>As strange as a computer museum sounds, it's really just the <a href="http://www.hfmgv.org/museum/default.asp">Henry Ford Museum</a> of the 21st Century - a place to see the birth of an industry that has changed American life.</p>

<p>This is a follow-up post to <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2004/05/library_geeks_u.html">Library Geeks Unite!</a>, which focused on Seattle's new downtown library. As Scoble also brought this location to my attention, I think it's time for him to put together a <b>Geek's Guide to the West Coast</b>, full of attractions, recommended restaurants, available behind-the-scenes tours, and locales of historical interest!</p>
