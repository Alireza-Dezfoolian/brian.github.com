<p>Inspiration, move me brightly<br />
light the song with sense and color,<br />
hold away despair<br />
More than this I will not ask<br />
faced with mysteries dark and vast<br />
statements just seem vain at last<br />
some rise, some fall, some climb<br />
to get to Terrapin</p>

<p>> Grateful Dead > Terrapin Station</p>
