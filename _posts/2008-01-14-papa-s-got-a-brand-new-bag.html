<p>My new bag from <a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/home">Timbuk2</a> has arrived! <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leaveitbehind/sets/72157603704626118/detail/">Check out the flickr set</a>. </p>

<p>This is a customized bag that I had way too much fun creating. With Timbuk2, you can choose the color and fabric for each panel, as well as the bag interior. There's nothing quite like getting <em>exactly</em> what you want.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/home">Timbuk2</a> experience was everything I heard it would be. I've always been a fan of their website, but this was the first time I actually used it. Every step is fun; I love how the first sentence in your confirmation email is "Your new bag is gonna ROCK!". So far, it does.</p>
