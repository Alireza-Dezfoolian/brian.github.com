<p>On Monday morning, I emailed the manuscript for <a href="http://www.bloggingchurch.com">The Blogging Church</a> to Jossey-Bass! Lori, Ben and I all gathered around the computer for the momentous click. Those two have been absolutely incredible throughout - there definitely wouldn't be a book without them.</p>

<p>The last month has been quite an experience. I've been writing nearly every waking moment that I wasn't working or eating. Most of it was a lot of fun as I do better when I have no choice but to focus on one thing. In many cases, I ended up writing more in a day than I used to write in a week, leading me to wonder what I've been doing for the past year :)</p>

<p>At least I wondered that until I totally hit a creative wall at the very end. That's when I doubted I would ever put coherent words together to form a sentence again! I was also surprised at how long the editing and formatting part took <em>after</em> the last words were written. I wish I had had about 2 weeks to do that, but I'm sure I'll have plenty of looks at it before everything is final. </p>

<p>The final word count was 63,298 over 16 chapters, 7 interviews, and 1 preface. Word count is something I knew nothing about before this book, so here's a little background. The average paperback has 250 words per page and the average hardcover has 300. <em>The Blogging Church</em> is going to be published in paperback, so the current version would be approximately 250 pages. To give some examples, <em>The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe</em> is 37K words, <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> is 100K, Harry Potter books are between 150K and 250K words, and the <em>New Testament</em> is 138K. </p>

<p>What's fascinating about the book process is that each step is something completely different. The proposal/contract process had little similarity with the last 9 months of writing, and next comes a few weeks of editing and revision, followed by the marketing fun of finalizing the cover and promotional details. </p>

<p>And just in case any of you might still be wondering if this whole thing is just <em>vaper-paper</em>, here's the (Currently Not Available) book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876/sr=8-1/qid=1148937333/ref=sr_1_1/002-6472235-1816849?%5Fencoding=UTF8">live on Amazon.com</a>!</p>
