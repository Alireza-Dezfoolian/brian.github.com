<p>Standard <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=barack+obama&btnG=Google+Search" target="_blank">Google search</a> for Barack Obama. Let's check out the paid advertising on the right and see how things are going in the online ad battle. </p><p>Let's see...first, we have the campaign site. Makes perfect sense.</p><p>Next, a YouTube link. Very reasonable, YouTube is a huge force in the campaign.</p><p>Third, an ad for newsmax.com. News website wants to pull in political readers. Excellent.</p><p>Fourth, an ad for a network security magazine. Hmmm, a little odd, but the company seems to be trying to link online scams to the presidential race. Guess it's worth a shot.</p><p>Now, let's see, what would this last one be... <b>NeimanMarcus Coupons</b>? Really? </p><p>No, really?</p><p>Are they picturing the Senator in an election night "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317705/" target="_blank">Honey, where's my super suit</a>?" commercial or something? What connection could the SEO marketing guru have devised to justify this ad buy?</p><p>I haven't seen the ad since, but it was there. I have proof.</p>
