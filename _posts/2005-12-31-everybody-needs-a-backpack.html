<p>If you're one of the more detail oriented visitors to this site, you will notice a small addition - an ad for <a href="http://www.backpackit.com/">Backpack</a> from <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37signals</a>. They recently <a href="http://backpackit.com/weblog/archives/new_features_updates/new_feature_backpack_affiliate_program_earn_free_service.php">released an affiliate program</a> and I only had to think about it for about 37 seconds before I decided to participate.</p>

<p> <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/11/my_socalled_onl.html">As I've said before</a>, Backpack is the one application I can't live without. I discover a new way that Backpack makes my life easier just about every day. I currently use it to remind me to get the oil changed, record all the movies I want to see and all the ones I've seen, track my to-do lists, manage a website redesign project, remind me to cancel a 30-day free subscription, and help me write a book. And this is just the start.</p>

<p>You can incorporate free <a href="http://www.writeboard.com/">Writeboard</a> pages for more in-depth writing and quickly share any page with as many people you want, including everyone. So, you and your team can track a project together or you and your spouse can plan your next vacation. Your whole family can share Christmas lists or your teenager can store all the details for her next paper in one place. For a few dollars a month, you can add images and files.<br />

</p>

<p><a href="http://backpackit.com/?referrer=BPZZS">Give it a try</a>, you can get started for free. All I get is more months of Backpack. All you get is one of the best, simplest, and most helpful apps out there. Plus, you can sound really cool at&nbsp; your New Year's Eve party when you talk about this great new <strong>Web 2.0</strong> tool you're using.</p>
