<p>Two great events in American soccer this week. The <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/headlinenews?id=295879&cc=5901">U.S. defeated Poland</a> on the road, 1-0 on a goal by DeMarcus Beasley and great goalkeeping by Brad Friedel. And then, Freddy Adu makes a <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/feature?id=296253&cc=5901">great professional debut</a>.</p>

<p>To celebrate, I purchased tickets for the April match at the Cotton Bowl between the U.S. and Mexico for me and the family. </p>
