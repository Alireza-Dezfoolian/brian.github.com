<p><a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/archive/">Peggy Noonan</a> is always worth reading, but when she writes a <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110006302&amp;ojrss=frontpage">fantastic essay on the world of blogs</a>, think of it as a must-read.</p>

<p>One particularly helpful reminder (and great turn of phrase):</p><blockquote><p>I've been attacked. Too bad. If you can't take it, you shouldn't be thinking aloud for a living.</p></blockquote>
