<p><a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a> just rolled out a brand-new version of <a href="http://www.backpackit.com/?referrer=BPZZS">Backpack</a>, the best way to manage your life online. You can <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/861-launch-backpack-multiuser-and-single-user">read the full post</a> announcing the release and covering the new features. Here's the <a href="http://www.backpackit.com/tour">new tour</a>.</p>

<p>What's new? Backpack now supports multiple users, so if your family or small business wants to share pages, files <em>and</em> calendars, it's now super-easy to do. There's finally a dead simple intranet option for organizations that is different than most solutions in one critical way &mdash; <strong>it will actually get used</strong>. </p>

<p>If you just want to use Backpack solo, you still can. For $7/month, you get 100 pages, 1GB of storage, and SSL throughout. There is also a free account.</p>

<p>I've always been a big fan of Backpack, but this is a whole new thing. If you're part of organization that has always wanted a single place where staff and volunteers could share information, calendars, even reminders (including SMS), definitely <a href="http://www.backpackit.com/?referrer=BPZZS">give Backpack a try</a>. I can't think of better option, especially for churches and non-profits.</p>
