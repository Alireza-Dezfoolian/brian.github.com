<p><a href="http://www.barackobama.com/" target="_blank">Barack Obama</a> is on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032608/" target="_blank">Meet the Press</a> this Sunday. If you have any interest in next year's election, this will be worth watching. Whether you are a Democrat or a Republican or neither, Obama's campaign is truly a historic one. Though the odds of him winning the nomination remain slim, he is also most likely the only one standing in the way of Senator Clinton becoming the nominee, an equally historic achievement. </p><p>There won't be another primary season like this one for many years. Though it's filled with flaws and frustrations, we'll miss this time in a few months when the candidates have been chosen and there are still 6-8 months left.</p>
