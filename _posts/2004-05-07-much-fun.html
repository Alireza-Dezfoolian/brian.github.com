<p>Lori and I had great couples night as we enjoyed dinner at <a href="http://www.bucadibeppo.com/">Buca di Beppo</a> in Southlake with Katie and Eric. Ben and Jake spent the evening with our excellent neighborhood sitter and we got to spend an evening full of great food and laughs. It's easy to forget how much a fun a night out can be, especially after years of parenthood. You find yourself wondering whether you have the time to <em>sacrifice</em> a Friday night, and then pulling into the driveway wishing it wouldn't end!</p>

<p>But, the boy, is always, <strong>always</strong> a joy to come home to!</p>
