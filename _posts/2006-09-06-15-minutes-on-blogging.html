<p><a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com">Scoble</a> was recently interviewed by one of his new Podtech co-workers. If you've ever wanted to hear a quick and clear case for blogging, <a href="http://www.podtech.net/technology/1034">this is it</a>. Scoble presents an engaging, enthusiastic, truly heartfelt argument for corporations and organizations to embrace blogging and join the conversation happening all around them. </p>

<p>"If I don't find you, you don't exist."</p>

<p>As he shows, blogging is a powerful tool that allows you to talk to Google (marketing and search results) and to the people who are part of these word-of-mouth networks. </p>

<p>If someone told me I had 15 minutes to convince them of why blogging is worth doing, this is what I would want them to hear. </p>
