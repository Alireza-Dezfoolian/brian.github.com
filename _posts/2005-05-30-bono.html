<p>I finished my first piece of vacation reading yesterday,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1573223093/qid=1117483343/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-3137039-4580935?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Bono: in conversation with Michka Assayas.</a> The book is essentially a 320-page interview of U2's lead singer by a French journalist. If you have the slightest interest in U2 and Bono, I think you would find it highly entertaining. If you're a fan, I don't think you'll be able to put it down.</p>

<p>The book tells much of Bono's life story, with a great deal of introspection about his childhood and his parents. There is also a lot of material about the band and its members. The majority of the book focuses on his faith and activism. All of it is fascinating.</p>

<p>There is so much interesting material that I'll probably incorporate it in a number of different posts, but here is a good place to start:</p><blockquote><p>Coolness might help in your negotiation with people through the world, maybe, but it is impossible to meet God with sunglasses on. It is impossible to meet God without abandon, without exposing yourself, being raw.</p></blockquote>
