<p>Leave it behind<br />
You've got to leave it behind<br />
All that you fashion<br />
All that you make<br />
All that you build<br />
All that you break<br />
All that you measure<br />
All that you steal<br />
All this you can leave behind<br />
All that you reason<br />
All that you sense<br />
All that you speak<br />
All you dress up <br />
All that you scheme</p>

<p>> U2 > Walk On > All That You Can't Leave Behind</p>
