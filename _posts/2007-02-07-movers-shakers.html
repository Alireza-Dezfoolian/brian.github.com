<p>Amazon has a list of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/movers-and-shakers/books/ref=pd_ts_mte/002-6847152-0888045">Top 100 Movers & Shakers</a> made up of the books that have had the biggest sales rank jump in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">The Blogging Church</a> recently <strong>hit #3 on the list</strong>! And the #1 book was featured on the Today show this morning, so that doesn't count :) </p>

<p>It's currently #6. Even better, the book broke through the #200 barrier and is now <strong>ranked #163 out of all books</strong>.</p>

<p>I promise not to bore you with box scores and inside baseball day after day! In exchange, I'm asking for just one small favor...</p>

<p>If you're planning on buying the book sometime soon, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">buy it today from Amazon</a>. Or pick up a few copies if you're planning on sharing the book with your team or fellow staff members. It's extremely rare for a book to land in <strong>Amazon's Top 100</strong> and this is likely the single best chance <em>The Blogging Church</em> will have to make its move. Let's see if we can make it happen!</p>

<p>Also, if you've already read your copy, posting your review on Amazon is also a huge help.</p>

<p>Thanks for your support of this project - it's greatly appreciated and is the main reason (other than God's grace) that it's been successful.</p>

<p>And one more thing, a gentleman in Pennsylvania has won the <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2007/01/contest.html">book photo contest</a>! More on that soon.</p>
