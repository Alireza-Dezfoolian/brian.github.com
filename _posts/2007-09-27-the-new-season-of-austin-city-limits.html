<p>One of my favorite music shows on television has announced the schedule for the new season which starts in October. <a href="http://www.pbs.org/klru/austin/">Austin City Limits</a> always produces great content, but this year's list is truly outstanding, including Wilco, Norah Jones, Van Morrison, Regina Spektor, Lucinda Williams, John Mayer and many more. Plus, it's now available in HD!</p>
