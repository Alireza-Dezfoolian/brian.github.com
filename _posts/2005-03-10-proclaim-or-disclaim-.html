<p><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/03/10.html#a9589">Scoble posted</a> some interesting comments on whether a person can truly partition off their professional life on a public blog.</p><blockquote><p>The reality is you're always representing your employer when you talk in public, no matter how many disclaimers you make.</p></blockquote><p>I think this is the bottom-line reality of speaking in public spaces. Particularly within the church world, your readers will always see you as a representative of your church (or, in an even larger sense, of Christianity). Once you accept that responsibility, the lines become much clearer.&nbsp; We are currently working through a personal websites/blogging policy and this is exactly the conclusion we've reached.
