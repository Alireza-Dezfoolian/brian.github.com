<p><a href="http://www.coudal.com/regrets.php">Regrets</a> is one of the best short films I've seen. It was created by the talented team at <a href="http://www.coudal.com/">Coudal Partners</a> and featured in Jim Coudal's talk at South By Southwest.</p>

<p>It's absolutely hilarious, with a touch of sweet sadness, but Jim used it to celebrate our curiosity. Each of us finds joy at a different stage within the process of discovery. Some of us live to brainstorm new ideas, others love the creative work, and others still love the finished product above all else. </p>

<p>However you're wired up, seek out opportunities to get your fix. Don't hate the part of you that most makes you feel alive.</p>
