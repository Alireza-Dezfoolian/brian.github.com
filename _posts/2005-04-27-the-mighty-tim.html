<p>Tim O'Reilly is one of the most consistently interesting people in technology. I have great respect for the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a> company and their outstanding <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/new.html">books</a>, <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/">conferences</a>, and now, <a href="http://www.makezine.com/">magazines</a>. Lately, Tim's been posting a lot of interesting insights into the world of books on <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/tim/">O'Reilly Radar</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/04/my_own_take_on.html">Today's post on marketing writing</a> featured this fantastic line:</p><blockquote><p>I try to encourage marketing copy that focuses on telling the truth, simply and powerfully, about why the ideas that we are passionate about are important for others to pay attention to as well.</p></blockquote><p>All public writing should aspire to this standard, whether you're speaking for your church, your company, or yourself.</p>
