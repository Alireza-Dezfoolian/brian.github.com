<p>The always interesting Jennifer Rice of <a href="http://brand.blogs.com/mantra/">What's Your Brand Mantra?</a> posted a great piece on how to measure your brand's strength.</p>

<p><a href="http://brand.blogs.com/mantra/2005/02/whos_volunteeri.html">Who's Volunteering?</a></p><blockquote><p>Great brands have passionate customers. They'll work for free. They'll sell better than your paid sales force. They'll write code. They'll create online fan clubs.</p>

<p>Here's a key indicator: If your employees aren't passionate, your customers probably aren't, either.</p></blockquote><p>This is another terrific business principle that also speaks to the local church. If you're a church leader, take a moment to think about your staff and volunteers. Is your church filled with a passion to serve and grow and reach out? Do you have volunteers who are more passionate about the church and its mission than some staff? And the ultimate question: if your staff or volunteers are lacking that passion, why?</p>
