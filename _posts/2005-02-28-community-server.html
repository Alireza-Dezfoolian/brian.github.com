<p>The free .NET web tool <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/RHoward/archive/2005/02/25/380444.aspx">Community Server</a> has now been officially released. The 1.0 version was announced on <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rhoward/">Rob Howard's blog</a>. The source code is also available.</p>

<p>Community Server includes tools for hosting multiple blogs (formerly <a href="http://scottwater.com/Links">.Text</a>), forums, and photo galleries. We hope to experiment with this release over the next two weeks for a number of different purposes, including possible volunteer communities.
