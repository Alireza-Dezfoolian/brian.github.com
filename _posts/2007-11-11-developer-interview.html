<p><a href="http://atomicwang.org/motherfucker/Index/Index.html" target="_blank">Mike Lee</a> is one of the talented people behind <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/" target="_blank">Delicious Library</a>, a great, beautifully done Mac app that allows you to catalog all of your stuff. The new version, built specifically with Leopard in mind, is quickly approaching release. </p><p>Check out <a href="http://blog.wearesakuzaku.com/lunch-with-you-mike-lee/" target="_blank">this excellent interview</a> and profile by <a href="http://wearesakuzaku.com/about" target="_blank">Sakuzaku</a>. Lots of very interesting tidbits.</p><p>The best part of the read for me was bringing <a href="http://atomicwang.org/motherfucker/Index/B4F177CD-1A08-4DF8-AEB6-F8AA6894835D.html" target="_blank">this post by Mike</a> to my attention. He <a href="http://atomicwang.org/motherfucker/Index/B4F177CD-1A08-4DF8-AEB6-F8AA6894835D.html" target="_blank">writes about the power of charity</a>, and how it can be incorporated into the buying process and really into a way cool approach to customer service in general. It's a powerful idea that involves spreading good will and good vibes instead of frustration and aggravation.</p><blockquote>Customers love this. They go from being extremely frustrated to extremely impressed, which probably nets us more sales in the long run from word of mouth.</blockquote>
