<p>What a day for Spartan fans! <a href="http://sports-att.espn.go.com/ncb/gameupdate?gameId=254000046">Michigan State 94 - Kentucky 88</a> and a trip to the NCAA Final Four to face North Carolina next Saturday. </p>

<p><a href="http://bailey.typepad.com">Lori</a> and I both graduated from <a href="http://msu.edu/">MSU</a> (Class of '92) with degrees in philosophy and journalism. Lori, in fact, is a third-generation Spartan. Michigan State is a great school and has one of the beautiful campuses you will see.</p>
