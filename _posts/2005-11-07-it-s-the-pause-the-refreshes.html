<p><h2>Refresh Dallas is here!</h2></p>

<p>What is <a href="http://www.refreshdallas.org/">Refresh Dallas</a>? I'll let <a href="http://www.garrettdimon.com/archives/refresh-dallas">Garrett Dimon</a>, one of the creators tell you:</p>

<p><blockquote>While there are many designers and web standards people in Dallas, there is no strong community presence. We hope to fix that by providing a web standards oriented design group for people to learn and share ideas about the present and future state of web development.</blockquote></p>

<p>The first meeting will be held this Thursday in Plano. <a href="http://www.refreshdallas.org/">Check the site for details</a> and let them know you're coming.</p>
<p>There are a number of terrific people involved in this and the kickoff topic looks terrific:</p>

<blockquote>We&rsquo;ll discuss the strengths and weaknesss of folksonomies, faceted classifications, site maps, wireframes, page description diagrams, HTML rapid prototyping, and more.</blockquote>

<p>If you're in the DFW Metroplex and interested in standards-driven web design with a heart for usability, don't miss this chance to be part of a brand-new community. I plan on being there along with Brad and Jeph - leave a comment if you'll be stopping by.</p>
