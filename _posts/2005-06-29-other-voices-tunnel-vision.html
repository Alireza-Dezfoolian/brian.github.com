<p><strong><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">Guest Post by <a href="http://www.misterorange.com/">Evan Erwin</a> </span></strong></p>

<p>I read a lot of blogs. I bet you do too. I think we all agree that
there is a lot of good content out there just waiting to be
discovered. There is also a lot of garbage out there. The distinction
between good content and garbage is not quite as clear cut as one
would imagine. Matter of fact, the distinction is merely a point of
view. In the eye of the beholder, and all that.

</p>

<p>I want to talk today about tunnel vision.

</p>

<p>What is tunnel vision? The <a href="http://www.american-depot.com">American Medical Depot</a> describes it as &quot;Loss of
peripheral vision so that only objects directly ahead can be seen.&quot;

</p>

<p>But the medical version of tunnel vision isn't what I'm here to talk
about, as you probably guessed. I'm here to talk about what you absorb
on a day to day basis, and how those choices impact your ways of
thinking and your outlook on life.

</p>

<p>For example, one of the staunch differences between conservatives and
liberals is abortion. It is not tunnel vision to say you have an
opinion about it, but it <em>is</em> tunnel vision to not seek out just
<em>why</em> the &quot;other side&quot; believes what they do. Sometimes those
lines of right and wrong are not only fuzzy, they disappear depending
on the argument. We are all God's Children, as they say, but what of
the line-blurring effects of a rape baby? A crack baby? A baby that is
deformed or confirmed after many exhaustive tests to be brain damaged
or, worse, brain dead?

</p>

<p>And you thought this was going to be simple. And we've not yet
<em>begun</em> on the biggest indicator of your own tunnel vision: Your
blog subscription list.

</p>

<p>It's no surprise that people drift toward others with the same
interests. Whether it's religion, baseball, or stamp collecting,
everyone likes to find people with the same passion as themselves. And
when it comes to things like faith, passion is its middle name. So
what can be done to broaden those horizons?

</p>

<p>Listen. Learn. Read. Find blogs that you've never heard of,
particularly those with a &quot;slant&quot; towards one &quot;side&quot; or another, and
subscribe to them. See what those people, those on the &quot;other side&quot;
are passionate about. What gets them upset? What gets them blogging?
What drives their passion?

</p>

<p>We fear what we do not understand. And with the power of blogs, there
should be no topic that isn't written about to some degree. Businesses
now blog to help customers understand their culture and approach. Passionate people blog about their interests and beliefs.
So why are most only getting one-sided discussions?

</p>

<p>In this blog-centric world that you and I live in (you <em>are</em>
reading this blog, so that tells me a few things about yourself just
by reading these words), subscriptions are everything. No one wants to
be ignored, and everyone wants to put their two cents in toward
whatever the hot topic of the day happens to be. It is simply more
convenient to subscribe to your favorite author, one who puts the
words into the ideals in your head. Far more convenient than trying to
find an opposing viewpoint, that's for sure.

</p>

<p>But it goes deeper than that. Talking about the Michael Jackson trial
or the medical marijuana issue is one thing, but finding equally true
and passionate voices on both sides of an issue is another. So with
that said I'll leave you with a challenge: Find blogs are on the
opposite end of your beliefs and ideals. Subscribe to them for a week.
Listen to what they have to say and, even more importantly, what they
<em>don't</em> say. I think you'll be surprised at how often each side
&quot;conveniently&quot; leaves out details, facts, and points that the other
may be jumping up and down about.

</p>

<p>I'd like to tell you this challenge will change your outlook and revolutionize your life, but I won't. What I will promise is that you
will be a better person, a more open person, and at the very least, a
more educated person to defend your own passions.

</p>

<p>There may be people out there we do not like, speaking to thousands
who disagree with your own beliefs. But to find out why they are so
passionate, and why there are so many, <em>that</em> is where
transcendence happens: To see what you originally could not, to think
about what you had not noticed, because your tunnel vision blurred
your view.</p>
