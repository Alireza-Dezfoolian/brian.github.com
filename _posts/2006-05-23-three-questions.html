<p>1. When did <em>blog</em> become a noun describing a single blog post? More and more, I've heard people refer to a "blog they wrote" or ask "did you see that blog of Scoble's yesterday?" They're not referring to the blog itself, but to a single post. Interesting.</p>

<p>Of course, I still think blogs should be called <strong>weblogs</strong> - I loved that word (may it rest in peace). </p>

<p>2. If you're making scrambled eggs and toast, and you have in front of you a bowl of scrambled eggs, 2-3 slices of bread, and a skillet, is there any good reason not to turn that combination into french toast? Besides the fact that syrup would now be involved, I certainly couldn't think of one. In fact, why would someone consume eggs any other way? </p>

<p>3. Do you realize that the phrase <em>upper deck</em> has been removed from the world of baseball? I was shopping for some baseball tickets to coincide with our summer vacation and discovered that in the modern world, there is the <em>upper terrace</em> and the <em>upper box</em>, but no upper deck. </p>

<p>Wouldn't that be a great home run call? <em>Wow! Bonds just hit one deep into the upper terrace!</em></p>
