<p>Robin Good does it again. This post describes two great <a href="http://www.masternewmedia.org/news/2004/09/06/browserbased_spell_checking_of_web.htm">browser-based spell checkers</a>, one for <a href="http://www.iespell.com">Internet Explorer</a> and one for <a href="http://spellbound.sourceforge.net/ ">Firefox</a>. These are essential tools for anyone who writes online and wants to avoid the typo-curse. I'm using Spellbound for Firefox currently and it works great.</p>
