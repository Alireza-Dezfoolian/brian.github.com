<p>Since most of the people who read this blog already have careers, let's imagine what career you would choose for your children. Money Magazine just ranked the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bestjobs/">Top 10 Best Jobs in America</a> and here's what they came up with [via <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3298">Brent Simmons</a>].</p>

<ul><li>1. Software Engineer</li>
<li>2. College Professor</li>
<li>3. Financial Adviser</li>
<li>4. Human Resources Manager</li>
<li>5. Physician Assistant</li>
<li>6. Market Research Analyst</li>
<li>7. Computer IT Analyst</li>
<li>8. Real Estate Appraiser</li>
<li>9. Pharmacist</li>
<li>10. Psychologist</li>
</ul>

<p>The two biggest surprises for me are that College Professor is number two (I don't think philosophy and political science professors are what they're talking about) and the fact that I have considered or actually done 4 out of the 10 of these since I was in college. </p>

<p>I can honestly say that my current position is my dream role - helping a team of designers and developers create <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/08/have_a_cup_of_c.html">outstanding websites</a> that serve the local church. When I reflect on that sentence, I honestly can't believe I get to do this every day. How many of these positions could exist - 100? And then I get to do it at <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com">Fellowship Church</a>. If you want to see some of the cool things we get to work on, check out the <a href="http://grapevine.fellowshipchurch.com">current homepage</a> and the new <a href="http://grapevine.fellowshipchurch.com/tc">Town & Country site</a>. Wow, I am truly blessed. </p>

<p>That little excursion wasn't the point of this post, however. If you could choose a career for your child, what would you choose? Right now, Ben would tell you he'd like to be a programmer, but only if he was creating games. I can't imagine what the top 10 jobs will be in 10 years, but Ben has shown me one thing already. It is very clear that he is determined to do something he loves, whether or not that translates directly into money and prestige. I couldn't be more proud of that, even it meant another philosophy major in the family :)</p>
