<p>Two great examples of how word of mouth is changing promotion and marketing. </p>

<p>First, Amazon's <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.01/bezos.html">Jeff Bezos in Wired Magazine</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Yes, more and more money will go into making a great customer experience, and less will go into shouting about the service. Word of mouth is becoming more powerful. If you offer a great service, people find out.</p></blockquote><p>Second, <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/001022.php">Jason Fried</a> on 37Signals' recent launch of <a href="http://www.tadalist.com/">Ta-Da Lists</a>, a clever, free, online list manager that is also sharable.</p><blockquote><p>In just the first 24 hours of operation, and just through blog word-of-mouth (and subsequent real word of mouth), over 2500 people have signed up for Ta-da List accounts. We havenâ€™t even sent out a note to our few-thousand strong mailing list. 2500 accounts started from a single blog post on SvN.</p></blockquote><p>How can you get people talking about your organization?</p>
