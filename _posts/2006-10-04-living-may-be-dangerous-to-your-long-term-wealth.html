title: Living may be dangerous to your long-term wealth

<p>Isn't it fascinating how so many things are determined by your perspective?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://wsj.com">Wall Street Journal</a> featured an article today about retirement: "An Age-Old Problem: How to Make Sure Your Money Lasts as Long as You Do". The focus was on how ever-increasing age expectancies mean that your lifetime savings may not be enough for you to live comfortably into your 80's or even 90's. Excellent story, good reminder, and even a well-done headline.</p>

<p>Here's the rather odd paragraph that caught me off guard:</p>

<p>"There may be 5% to 10% of 65-year-olds who are in poor enough health that they don't have to worry about living a long time,' says Ken McCullum, a senior vice president in Harford's wealth-management group. "But the other 90% or 95% could live a very long time. <strong>There's a lot of uncertainty for those folks</strong>." [emphasis added]</p>

<p>Yes, indeed. Thankfully, a few of us (we can only hope) will pass away before reaching 70. But God help me if I'm one of those unfortunate people who might "live a very long time" and face a great deal of uncertainty!</p>

<p>We've been taught to fear death, running out of money, terrorism, spinach, failing to provide for our children's future, computer viruses, going to school, and internet stalkers. I suppose it was only a matter of time before someone decided to profit by making us fear - living!</p>
