<p>As many of you know, the <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2006/11/the_one_thing.html">final chapter</a> of <a target="amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/0787984876&amp;tag=leaveitbehind-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">the book</a> features advice from 16 very different bloggers. I've received a lot of positive feedback on that chapter, particularly because of the diverse and decidedly super-cool people who participated (<a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2006/11/the_one_thing.html">see the full list</a>). I think the other reason is that it shows the incredible variety of perspectives on blogging and gives people permission to experiment since there really isn't just one way to blog.</p>

<p>Putting together a chapter like that is fun because you get to seek out interesting people, somewhat like dreaming up my ideal dinner party. I was amazed at some of the people who agreed to participate, which proves that it's always worth asking. There were a few other people from outside the church world I asked, many of the stupendously unlikely category, and I thought it would be fun to share them... </p>

<p>Again, I had no expectation that these would be possible (especially at about 22 degrees of separation), but I did receive some kind replies.</p>
<p>The real question is, who do you wish had been part of <em>The One Thing</em>? What blogger (Christian or otherwise) would you have loved to have heard from?</p>
