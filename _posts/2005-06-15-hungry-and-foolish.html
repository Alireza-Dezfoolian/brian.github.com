<p>Steve Jobs gave the commencement address at Stanford this weekend and it is a wonderful read. You can read the <a href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/grad-061505.html">article here</a> and the <a href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505">full transcript here</a>. [via <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/remember_you_are_going_to_die.php">SvN</a>]</p>

<p>Jobs talks movingly of three pivotal moments in his life and what he learned from each of them: dropping out of college, being fired from Apple, and being diagnosed with cancer. When he was first diagnosed, he spent one entire day with the knowledge (later proved false, thankfully) that he had less than a year to live.</p><blockquote><p>Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything â€“ all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that your are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.</p></blockquote><p>He closes with a line from <em>The Whole Earth Catalog</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.</strong></p>
