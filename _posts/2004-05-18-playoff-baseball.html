<p>Tonight was our first official experience of playoff baseball, and a happy one at that as Ben's Angels won. If they win on Thursday night, they will play for the league championship.</p>

<p>The game was completely different than any of his games in the last 4 seasons. Ben said afterwards that it was the most exciting game he'd ever played. The coaches, players, and, yes, <em>fans</em> were so much more focused and enthusiastic. It was a close game until late and very tense.</p>

<p>Ben had 2 singles, scored a run, and had a few smart, hustle plays. All in all, very fun, but Thursday will be a challenge (for all of us!).</p>
