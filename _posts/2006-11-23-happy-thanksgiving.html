<p>Wishing everyone a wonderful day with friends and family! </p>

<p>Lori is making an incredible meal, the sky is blue and the temperature is 71, Ben and I are headed outside and a mix of Coldplay and Frank Sinatra is playing in the background.</p>

<p>At each Thanksgiving meal, all of us share three things that we're thankful for. Of course, the hardest part is narrowing the list to three - I am so blessed, especially by Ben and Lori. One of the rules, though, is that the three things can't be those of us sitting around the table.</p>

<p>Here are my three for 2006:</p>

<p>I'm thankful that I am able to work and worship at <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com">Fellowship Church</a>. There's simply no other place like it. And I get to work with so many outstanding people, especially Jeph and Brad.</p>

<p>I'm thankful for music. I'm continually amazed at the ability of music to change my mood, make me think, help me work and write, and inspire me. </p>

<p>I'm thankful for the web. As funny as that sounds, I wouldn't have the job I have, the opportunity to write a book, or the chance to meet so many interesting and diverse people, without the web. Every day there are a new ideas, new tools, and new people waiting to be discovered. Thanks for spending some of your time here!</p>

<p><strong>What are you thankful for?</strong></p>

<p>Finally, tonight we continue our <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2004/11/start_your_own_.html">family tradition of reading a book together</a> during the holidays. We start a book (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRascal-Sterling-North%2Fdp%2F0140344454%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1164318349%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;tag=leaveitbehind-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Rascal</a> - our all-time favorite) on Thanksgiving and read it each night until we finish it on Christmas Eve.  It's a wonderful way to make sure you experience some quiet time together every night during this crazy time of year. Just pick a favorite book and get started!</p>
