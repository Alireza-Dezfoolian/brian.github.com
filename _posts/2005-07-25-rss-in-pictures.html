<p>I love it when my son, Ben, introduces me to cool new computer things. This is starting to happen more and more - I'm convinced that age 10 (which is what he will be in two months) is when this becomes common.</p>

<p>Yesterday, he asked me if I wanted to see his blog as a screensaver. I laughed and assumed he was going to show me something, certainly, but whatever it was, it wasn't going to <em>actually</em> be his blog as a screensaver. I walked in and sat down and there it was - his blog title immediately followed by his last five posts, spinning on the screen in a way only Apple could do. Very cool!</p>

<p>If you have Tiger, you'll find the RSS Screensaver option within System Preferences. Your feed options are based on the RSS feeds you've subscribed to in Safari, so make sure to add them there first. To get an idea of what it looks like, here's <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000807035571/">an Engadget post</a> with images. <em>Thanks, Ben!</em></p>
