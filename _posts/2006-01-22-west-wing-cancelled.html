<p>The best show on television and <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/09/10_favorite_tv_.html">my favorite show</a> of all-time is officially ending. <em>The West Wing</em> <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060122/ap_en_tv/tv_nbc_west_wing">was cancelled today</a>. The final episode will air on May 14th.</p>

<p>The show lasted 7 seasons. It was obvious it wasn't likely to last much longer, but it's still a sad day. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200276/">The West Wing</a> was the only show that I scheduled my evening around. It has remained incredibly consistent and filled with quality writing. The political conversations and plots weren't just window dressing for a show about relationships - they were actually the point of the show.</p>

<p>The only comfort is that the old episodes are endlessly entertaining, so like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165961/">Sports Night</a>, I can get my <em>West Wing</em> fix whenever I need it.</p>

<p>Alright <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0815070/">Aaron</a>...hurry up and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485842/">write your next show</a>!</p>
