<p>Here's an update on last month's post, <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/05/5_feeds.html">Five Feeds</a>. My subscription list is now down to <strong>44</strong> and I couldn't be happier! I no longer dread opening my newsreader and can finally keep up with the volume of material. Better still, I now give that material the attention it deserves, rather than obsessively skimming in order to <em>get through</em> the posts.</p>

<p>My tool of choice, <a target=_new href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a>, provides a clever tool that shows you which of your feeds hasn't updated in a number of days [<a target=_new href="http://ranchero.com/images/nnw2/dinosaurs.png">view example</a>]. This is very handy. I found it interesting that only 2 of my 44 feeds hadn't updated at least once in the last 10 days. This gave me the idea for, what else, a list!</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em;"><strong>Top 5 Ways to Keep Subscribers</strong></span></p>

<p>1. Send the full text of your posts. <br /> </p>

<p>2. Update your blog every 7-10 days.</p>

<p>3. Don't include ads. I'll post more about <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/06/money_changes_e.html">my week experiment</a> soon.</p>

<p>4. Provide interesting, original content that can't be found elsewhere </p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>5. Provide the extremely valuable service of a <em>human aggregator</em>, someone who knows a subject inside and out, follows the relevant sites and blogs obsessively, and provides a summation for her readers.</p>
