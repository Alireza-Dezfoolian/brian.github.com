<p>The interview for the <a href="http://books.typepad.com/podcasts/2007/03/brian_bailey_th.html">TypePad Books Podcast</a> is now online. Harold did a great job editing our lengthy conversation into a much more accessible 20 minutes that still touches on a lot of different topics. <a href="http://books.typepad.com/podcasts/2007/03/brian_bailey_th.html">Download the MP3 here</a>.</p>
