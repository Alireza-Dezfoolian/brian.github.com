<p>Registration for this year's <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/">Open Source Convention</a> is now open! O'Reilly has released all of the conference details, include <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/38/keynotes.html">keynotes</a>, <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/38/sessions.html">sessions</a> (including <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/38/track_php.html">PHP</a>, <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/38/track_linux.html">Linux</a> and <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/38/track_security.html">Security</a> tracks) and <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/38/register.html">pricing</a>. The conferences offers an incredible <strong>40% discount</strong> to non-profits!</p>

<p>Very few conferences are worth the cost of airfare, hotel, food and registration (which is why we are so blessed to have <a href="http://www.sxsw.com">SXSW</a> a mere three hours away), but if you're in the northwest and immersed in open source development, definitely check out <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/">OSCON</a>.</p>

<p>The conference is in Portland, August 1-5. </p>
