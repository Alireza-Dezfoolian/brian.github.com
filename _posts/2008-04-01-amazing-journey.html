<p>Today marks the four year anniversary of Leave It Behind! I've written nearly a thousand posts since then, but more importantly had the chance to meet and get to know a lot of wonderful people. Thank you for reading and sharing your thoughts through comments and emails &mdash; it's truly been an amazing journey.</p>

<p>Recently I was given the chance to use some of my experiences and background to help make my favorite blogging tool just a little bit better. I've been using TypePad to publish this blog since 2004, along with our new <a href="http://www.familyreads.com">Family Reads site</a> and a few other projects. <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">Six Apart</a>, the company behind <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">TypePad</a> and <a href="http://www.movabletype.com/">Movable Type</a>, started a Customer Advisory Board for TypePad to help guide the software and make sure it's meeting the community's needs. They were kind enough to invite me to participate and I eagerly accepted. I love giving feedback on UI design and testing new features, and to do so for this company and this tool is a privilege (and an unpaid one at that, just to be upfront). On the plus side, I finally got to sign an NDA (no secrets for you!) and I'm holding out hope for a t-shirt.</p>

<p>If you're a TypePad user and have some questions or wishes you'd like me to pass along, I'm happy to do it. </p>

<p>Right now, I'm thinking about blogging more than actually blogging. The past six months at the <a href="http://alamofire.com/">coolest game startup on the planet</a> (creators of the <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/packrat/">best game on Facebook</a>) have been incredible. Each day is filled with new ideas, things to learn, and fantastic people. I've had the chance to think more creatively than ever before, which leaves a little less creativity to share at the end of the day. You can follow my daily thoughts at <a href="http://twitter.com/bb">twitter.com/bb</a>, which has become a very fun community and outlet.</p>

<p>I had a wonderful email conversation with my friend Julie about how blogging differs for each of us. It's something I'm still mulling over. I hope to share some of that in the near future.</p>

<p>In the meantime, thanks again for being part of this journey and in many ways making it possible!</p>
