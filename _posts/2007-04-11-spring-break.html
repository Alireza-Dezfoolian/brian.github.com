<p><em>Leave It Behind</em> will be quiet over the next few weeks. I'm going to take a break from blogging and focus on Ben's last few weeks of elementary school, our annual father/son trip, summer planning, and some surprises for Lori. There is also a lot to learn, a few exciting possibilities to explore, and an idea for a second book I need to flesh out.</p>

<p>When I return, the blog will likely head in a slightly different direction. After three years of blogging and investing nearly two years in <em>The Blogging Church</em>, I'm beginning to feel like a band that's been touring for months supporting their latest album - it's time for some new songs.</p>

<p>As I look forward to the next chapter, I thought I'd share a piece over the next few days that I wrote recently for <em>Relevant Leader</em>. When they asked me to write an article about blogging in the church a few months ago, I was confidant I had said everything I wanted to say about the subject.&nbsp; but it turned out I had two thousand more words in me. In many ways, it feels like the epilogue to the book. </p>
