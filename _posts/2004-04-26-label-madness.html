<p>Though I enjoy politics, I am continually frustrated at the constant attempt to label an opponent or proposal into submission. In other words, if I can simply attach a negative label to you or your idea, and thereby define you, I will win. Let's review some recent attempts:</p>

<p>Vast right-wing conspiracy<br />
Ultra-right-wing conservative<br />
Left-wing liberal<br />
Card-carrying member of the ACLU<br />
Voodoo economics</p>

<p>and my personal, all-time favorite, Al Gore's</p>

<p><strong>Risky tax scheme</strong></p>

<p>Are there left-wing liberals in the world? Yes. Right-wing conservatives? Of course. But, no matter how many words are attached as a matter of emphasis (ultra, far, vast, fascist, communist, etc...) these are simplistic terms that do nothing to advance the debate and are disrespectful to opponents as well as the voters.</p>

<p>Also, these phrases avoid the fact that people (yes, even politicians) are far more nuanced than the labels we force on them. Nothing is as simple as it seems. For instance, consider this personal profile:</p>

<p>I own an electric lawn mower<br />
My favorite show is <em>The West Wing</em><br />
My TiVO regularly records <em>Austin City Limits</em> and <em>Soundstage</em><br />
My favorite computer is a Powerbook<br />
I regularly read the NY Times on the web<br />
I have a degree in Philosophy<br />
My wife and I drive Honda's<br />
I love World Cup Soccer<br />
My CD shelf is dominated by the Grateful Dead and Phish</p>

<p>Liberal or conservative?</p>
