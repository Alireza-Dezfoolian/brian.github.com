<p>Have a blog? Looking for detailed statistics? There's <a href="http://jwikert.typepad.com/the_average_joe/2005/05/blog_statistics.html">a lot of buzz</a> about <a href="http://www.statcounter.com/">StatCounter</a> right now. Has anyone used this free tool? I am mostly satisfied with <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com">MyBlogLog </a>and <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">Feedburner</a>, but StatCounter offers even more information for the numbers obsessed. </p>
