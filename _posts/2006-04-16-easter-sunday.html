<p>I hope everyone is having a wonderful, peaceful Easter! We've had a terrific weekend of serving, worshipping, relaxing, and eating. This is my seventh Easter as a member of Fellowship Church and I can say without a doubt that it was the most powerful one I have ever attended (yes, even more than the time <em>Bring Me to Life</em> was performed). Every element, from the music and video, to the message and environment, blended together perfectly to create a truly amazing experience.</p>

<p>For the first time, we also had an outdoor sunrise service. It was truly moving to worship in the quiet with the lake and the blue sky as a background. The message had a lot to do with planes, so this may have been one of the first services to feature airplanes as props, since planes destined for DFW Airport were frequently seen overhead.</p>

<p>The Easter message is <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com/currentseries">now available online</a> if you'd like to watch or listen.</p>

<p>This weekend's message talks a lot about the questions surrounding the death and resurrection of Christ. If you're interested in some more background on this, Pastor Mark Driscoll of <a href="http://www.marshillchurch.org/">Mars Hill Church</a> in Seattle recently posted a four part series on <a href="http://theresurgence.com/blog/2">his blog</a>. Mark is a great pastor and author who we recently had the privilege of interviewing for <a href="http://www.bloggingchurch.com">The Blogging Church</a>. If you live in the Seattle area (raise your hands Microsoft people!), you should definitely visit Mars Hill one of these weekends or grab one of their podcasts.</p>
