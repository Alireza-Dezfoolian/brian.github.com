<p>We're having a new washer and dryer installed tomorrow at the Bailey house. We got our current set when we moved into our house 10 years ago and they are finally ready to be retired. All of us are very excited to start fresh with a shiny new pair.</p>

<p>While I was saying goodnight to Ben, we started talking about tomorrow and I said, &quot;I sure hope it goes well and there's no surprises.&quot;</p>

<p>He said, &quot;I hope there are.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really? What kind of surprises?&quot;</p>

<p><strong>&quot;I hope they're even better than we think they're going to be.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Most of the time, I'm so focused on making sure things go &quot;right&quot; and nothing, God forbid, unexpected happens, that I can't even fathom that most of life's truly wonderful moments are, you guessed it, surprises!</p>

<p>Like this one.</p>
