<p>In case there are those of you out there that stay at Wyndham hotels fairly often but didn't know this, be sure to join the Wyndham By Request program. The program is free and as long as you book your stay through Wyndham directly, it entitles you to free Internet access during your stay!</p>

<p>You also receive some other freebies and free telephone calls, so it's definitely worth any marketing spam you might have to suffer through.</p>
