This weekend, we launched a new website for our fall message series - <a target="in2c" href="http://www.ineed2change.com">ineed2change.com</a>. The site was a huge amount of fun to work on. It's the first Flash site I've ever been involved with, which presented some interesting challenges, as well as opportunities to do different things.</p>

<p>The site simply asks, &quot;What do you want to change in your life?&quot; You can post your thoughts, as well as read what everyone else has submitted. There's also a fantastic short film, with three more installments on the way.</p>

<p>The response has been incredible so far. It's inspiring to see so many people who want to truly change their lives, and very affecting to read their struggles, hurts, and dreams.</p>

<p>We've setup a Twitter feed of all the submissions. You can follow along at <a target="twitter" href="http://twitter.com/ineed2change">twitter.com/ineed2change</a>.</p>

<p><a target="in2c" href="http://www.ineed2change.com">Check out the site</a>. The series begins 09-08-07. You can learn <a href="http://grapevine.fellowshipchurch.com/ineed2change" target="fc">more about it here</a>.
