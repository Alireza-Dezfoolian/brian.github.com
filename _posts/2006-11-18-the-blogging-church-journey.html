<p>Terry and I want to thank all of you who have been a huge part of the <strong>Blogging Church</strong> journey which began 15 months ago - through interviews, questions, feedback, comments, and encouragement. Now that the book release is just two months away (we received confirmation that pre-orders will <strong>ship on January 12</strong>), it's time for the next phase on this long, strange trip!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/bookjourney_1.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="324" height="243" border="0" alt="Bookjourney_1" title="Bookjourney_1" src="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/images/bookjourney_1.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>Two weeks ago, we received copies of the book galleys, or &quot;Advance Uncorrected Proof&quot; as they like to call it. The galleys are the last step before the release - you actually get to see the book as it will be in the final version. When the book is a hardcover, the galleys are substantially different, but since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/0787984876&amp;tag=leaveitbehind-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="amazon">The Blogging Church</a> is an affordable paperback, the galleys are very close to the real deal.</p>

<p>It was a thrill to hold the book at last. It's a great size and weight - it begs to be thrown in a bag for a long flight or a trip to the coffee shop. With its wide margins, it just looks like a book to be used - marked up, highlighted, and a few Post-It notes dangling from the pages. </p>

<p>The index isn't there yet, the last round of edits haven't been incorporated, and some of the design is still being finalized, but it's a real book at last!</p>

<p>And it's a book on the move - we're sending the book on a journey across the country! We've chosen one of our favorite bloggers to kick this off. On Monday, he'll receive the galleys, read as much as he likes, sign it, take a photo with the book and post it, then send it on to the blogger of his choice. Of course, we'll track the book's progress right here.</p>

<p>We had to start the journey right here in Texas. Here's the first picture - me, Terry, and the book!</p>
