<p>Here's a wonderful site, <a href="http://www.folklore.org/index.py">Folklore.org</a>, that tells the story of Apple Computer and the original Macintosh through the words of those who were there. A <a href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Software_Wizard.txt&sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&detail=medium&search=business%20card">particularly fun story</a> is how the tradition began that every Apple employee can create their own title for their business cards.</p>
