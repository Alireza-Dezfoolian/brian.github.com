<p>After <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2006/11/sunset_on_studi.html">my  post  last month</a>, Lori and I decided to stop watching Studio 60 and haven't missed it once. We're watching endless West Wing episodes on Bravo instead and loving every minute of it - wow, what a show! Watching Studio 60 felt like what church used to be for me - my favorite part was when it was over and I could check it off my list.</p>

<p>Today, <a href="http://www.scripting.com/2006/12/05.html#When:7:27:52PM">Dave wrote</a> that he agrees:</p>

<blockquote>I give up on Studio 60. It's dull, childish, plotless, not funny, not heart-grabbing, takes itself far too seriously. Not interesting. Wish they had used the money for this show to buy another season of The West Wing.</blockquote>

<p><em>Amen!</em></p>
