<p>Have you done any vanity searches on Google lately? If you have a blog, you may be familiar with the value Google's search engine assigns to weblogs. A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=brian+bailey">search for Brian Bailey</a> over the past six months would reliably return this blog as either the first or second result (curse you, <a href="http://www.brianbaileyphotography.com/">Brian Bailey Photography</a>!). A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=leave+it+behind">search for Leave It Behind</a> produced similar results.</p>

<p>Alas, those days appear to be over. My site no longer appears in the <strong>first four pages</strong> of both searches! Google has clearly made substantial changes to its search calculations. </p>

<p>In the past I've thought that Google overvalued weblogs in its rankings, but this drastic change is surprising. I'll be interested to see how much the results are tweaked over the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Other engines have not followed along so far; <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com">LeaveItBehind.com</a> is <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=brian+bailey">#1 on Yahoo</a> and <a href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=brian+bailey">#4 on MSN Search</a>.</p>
