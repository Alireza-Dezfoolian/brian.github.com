<p>I have so much to be thankful for this year. I'm simply blessed beyond words.</p>

<p>I am thankful for</p>

<p>...a loving God who desires nothing more than a personal relationship with his creation.</p>

<p>...my beautiful, inspiring, creative, and giving wife Lori who is a daily reminder of God's grace and love.</p>

<p>...my son Ben who truly has the ability to think different and force me to do the same. He also happens to be incredibly fun to be with and, if he doesn't mind me saying so, is the sweetest boy on earth.</p>

<p>...Fellowship Church, the amazing place where I am privileged to work and worship. God has used Fellowship and the wonderful people I work with to teach,&nbsp; challenge, and change me in innumerable ways. When I first started attending Fellowship, I said I would give anything to be a part of it. I still can't believe I get paid to do what I love in an environment overflowing with change and creativity.</p>

<p>...friends and family.</p>

<p>...and each of you, who take the time to read this rather eclectic collection of thoughts and share your insights and opinions.</p>

<p>Enjoy the rest of your Thanksgiving Weekend!<br /> </p>
