<p>After <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/01/one_in_a_hundre.html">recently being chosen</a> as a writer for the <em>100Bloggers</em> project, I understand that one of my first tasks is to select the next participant. I have a few people in mind who I'll be contacting shortly, but if you're a blogger and are interested, feel free to drop me a note or leave a comment here. Let me know what you love to write about and what your perspective would bring to the project.</p>

<p>You can read more about the project and the initial set of participants from the man who started it all: <a href="http://jstrande.typepad.com/blog/2005/01/blogging_book_p.html">Jon Strande</a>.</p>
