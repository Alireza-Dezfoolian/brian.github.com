<p>InfoWorld's Jon Udell <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/07/25.html">evaluates Bloglines</a>, a free web-based RSS newsreader, and comes to the conclusion that it's nearly perfect. I know many people who use <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> and have experimented with it myself. I especially recommend it to those who would like to experiment with weblogs, as it is currently free and accessible from any computer, so you don't have to install any software.</p>

<p>If you want better speed and a few more features, and are willing to part with $40, I recommend <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio Userland</a> (Mac or PC) and <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> (Mac).</p>
