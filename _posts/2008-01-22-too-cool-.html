<p>Our son Ben wrote <a href="http://www.familyreads.com/2008/01/warriors-power.html">a review of Dark River</a> on <strong>Family Reads</strong> and one of the book's authors <a href="http://www.familyreads.com/2008/01/warriors-power.html#comments">posted a kind comment</a>! </p>

<p>The book is part of the Warriors series, which he absolutely loves; so much so that he spent his own money on the latest book rather than wait for the library to get it. If you know a 9-12 year old who likes stories of adventure (especially ones involving cats), these books are definitely worth checking out.</p>

<p>I wish I could send him a text message to let him know, but he'll have to wait until he gets home from school :) </p>
