<p>If you've been curious about <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>, this is <a href="http://db.tidbits.com/article/9228">the best introduction</a> I've found. It's by Adam Engst of <a href="http://www.tidbits.com">TidBITS</a> fame and is especially good because he started out as a skeptic, like most people. If you don't have an account yet, now is <a href="https://twitter.com/signup?commit=Join">a good time to create one</a>. They've made some very nice design improvements lately and the overall stability is much improved. </p>
