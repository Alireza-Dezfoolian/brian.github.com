<p>Today is the day I launch my new weblog. I have been blogging on and off for nearly three years, but I have made two significant mistakes in the time. First, I have not been as consistent as I would like, allowing large gaps of inactivity. Second, I have moved from service to service and url to url, leaving my words spread across cyberspace without a permanent home. Beginning today, I hope to change these two things.</p>

<p>Why April 1? Well, it's always convenient to start something on the first of the month, and today has the added benefit of being April Fool's Day, which is, if nothing else, ironic. However, my true reason is today is the 7-year anniversary of Dave Winer's <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Scripting News</a>. I started reading Scripting News in 1999, easily my first exposure to weblogs. Though it's almost incomprehensible to me, in the 5+ years since then, I doubt I have missed a single day (or was unable to catch up immediately thereafter). This makes <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Scripting News</a> the most consistently read publication of my entire life!</p>

<p>Of course, I didn't just read <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Scripting News</a>, I bought and used many of Userland's products, which gave me my first, wonderful, experience of writing for and on the web. My thanks to Dave for terrific tools and fascinating reading for these many years. From now on, when Dave talks about a Scripting News anniversary, it will be a happy reminder of my own anniversary on the web.</p>
