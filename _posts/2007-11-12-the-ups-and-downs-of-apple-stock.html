<p>Apple (<a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?client=ob&q=AAPL" target="new">AAPL</a>) closed on November 6 at $191.79. Today, it closed at $153.67, a drop of <b>$38 per share</b> in four days. The market has certainly turned this week. I don't own Apple now, but I'd seriously consider getting back in if this bloodbath showed any signs of ending.</p>

<p><em>Update, November 13</em>: Apple closed up $16.20 today, a nearly 12% increase. Maybe next time I'll go with my instincts. Or maybe next time I'll ignore them. I can't tell which.</p>
