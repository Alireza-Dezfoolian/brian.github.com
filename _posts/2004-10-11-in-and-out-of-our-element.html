A few months ago, we traded in our Honda Civic and brought home an <a href="http://automobiles.honda.com/models/model_overview.asp?switch=language&ModelName=Element&bhcp=1&BrowserDetected=True">Element</a>. I had been thinking about the Element for nearly a year, but Ben was sold when he learned that the front and back seats could be folded to create two beds the length of the vehicle. Since I  did not grow up in a camping family, overnight excursions are not my first instinct, but what could be easier than travelling in your own hotel room!</p>

We've travelled to Houston, Austin, and Oklahoma City. For our camping excursion, we asked our local expert and settled on <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/park/rayrob/">Lake Ray Roberts</a>, less than an hour from home. This is a great state park and I highly recommend it. There are playgrounds, bathrooms, showers, and biking and hiking trails.</p>

We also had a great time inside the Element, reading, playing games, and listening to playoff baseball on the radio. Sleeping in the vehicle worked out perfect and we loved waking up with a perfect view of the lake.</p>
