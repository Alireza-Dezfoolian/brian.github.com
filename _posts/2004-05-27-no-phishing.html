<p>Yesterday Phish announced on <a href="http://www.phish.com">their website</a> that they are disbanding at the end of their summer tour, once and for all. I'm very sad to hear this, but completely trust and respect their judgement and determination to protect their past as well as their future. The NY Times has a<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/27/arts/music/27PHIS.html?8hpib"> terrific article</a> on the band that tells a very considerate story.</p>

<p>I only saw Phish in person two times, but I'm particularly proud of the first time. It was in 1992 at Michigan State University in the Student Ballroom. They were hardly known at the time and the room only held 400-500 people. It was an incredible concert and a wonderful part of my senior year.</p>
