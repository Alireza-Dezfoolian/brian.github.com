<p>Looking for a second computer? Time to get the kids their first Mac? I have a 3-year old iMac for sale. </p><p>The specs? 17" screen, 1.8GHz G5, 1GB of RAM, 160GB hard drive. I'd prefer to sell to someone in the Dallas area, but shipping is possible. $550 or best offer. Free, autographed copy of <i>The Blogging Church</i>, if you're into that sort of thing. </p><p>This is a family favorite, so we want it to go to good home where it will be loved, well fed, and played with regularly. Email me if you're interested.</p> 
<p><em>Update:</em> The iMac has been sold! Thanks for everyone's interest.</p>
