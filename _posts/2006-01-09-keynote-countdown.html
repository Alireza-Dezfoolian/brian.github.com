<p>So, you're sitting around, wondering how in the world you're going to fill the next 24 hours waiting for Steve Job's to announce the 8th Wonder of the World on <a href="http://www.macworldexpo.com/live/20/">Tuesday morning</a>. I was like you, until I discovered <a href="http://writersblocklive.com/">Mike Evangelist</a> [via <a href="http://www.christianheadlines.com/about">Barry</a>]</p>

<p>Mike is a former Apple employee who is writing a book about his career in the computer industry. He worked closely with Steve Jobs, including more than a few keynotes, and he has started to share some of his behind-the-scenes stories. They are truly fascinating reads. </p>
