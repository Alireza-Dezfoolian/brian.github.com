<p>Scoble directed me to a follow-up piece on his <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/06/07.html#a7715">10 Evangelism and IT Lessons</a> essay. Published by the fine people at <a href="http://www.creatingcustomerevangelists.com/">Creating Customer Evangelists</a>, the post is entitled <a href="http://customerevangelists.typepad.com/blog/2004/06/creating_a_chur.html">Church for Non-Profits</a>. Here's a brief sample.</p>

<blockquote>Fellowship Church isn't afraid to invest abundant time, money and resources into technology, creating a memorable experience and facilitating word of mouth online and offline. Among non-profits, that's pretty remarkable.</blockquote>

<p>The challenge for any non-profit, particularly a church, is to take risks, despite the conflict and resistance that inevitably arises. The method you use to communicate your message should reflect your community and your culture. The message itself, however, should never change.</p>

<p>In addition to a great website, Creating Customer Evangelists is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0793155614/ref=ase_wabalake-20/103-7195123-3723803?v=glance&s=books">also a book</a>, one I plan on reading this summer. <br />
