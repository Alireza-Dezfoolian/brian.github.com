<p>If I told you that there was an organization for people with hearing loss called SHHH, would you:</p>

<p>a) Believe me</p>

<p>b) Start laughing</p>

<p>c) Assume I was referencing a Seinfeld episode</p>

<p>Time's up. The correct answer is (a). Visit Self-Help for Hard of Hearing (People) or <a href="http://www.shhh.org/">SHHH.org</a>.</p>

<p>I was actually asking Google a spelling question for a story I'm working on when I saw that and could not stop laughing. Let me be clear, I have nothing but respect for those with hearing loss. Some of my best friends have hearing loss and I will probably be joining this organization sooner than most!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, SHHH.org should give hope and confidence to anyone who has ever sat in the back of a lengthy brainstorming session, surround by your peers, holding on to that one idea that is just too foolish to say outloud. I say, &quot;Go for it!&quot; You never know when someone else will say, &quot;You know, that's just crazy enough to work!&quot;</p>
