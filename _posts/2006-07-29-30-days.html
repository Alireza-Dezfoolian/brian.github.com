<p>A new season of <a href="http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/30days/main.html">30 Days</a> started this week, the show on FX by Morgan Spurlock, the man behind the documentary <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390521/">Super Size Me</a>.</p>

<p>The one-hour show follows a person spending 30 days in an environment completely unlike their own, with people who do not share their beliefs. Essentially, it's an fish-out-of-water experience. <strong>It's also one of the best shows on television.</strong></p>

<p>The first episode focused on immigration, placing a man determined to protect our borders with a family of illegal immigrants in Los Angeles. It's incredibly moving, powerful, and eye opening. The episode will air again on Monday and Tuesday, so find a way to watch it.</p>

<p>The rest of the season looks to be very interesting. The topics may sound sensational, but the show is immensely fair and does not pursue or celebrate conflict. </p>

<p><strong>Episode 2: Outsourcing.</strong> A software engineer who lost his job to outsourcing spends 30 days in India working at a call center.</p>

<p><strong>Episode 3: Atheist.</strong> An atheist spends 30 days with a couple who attends <a href="http://www.mcfbc.org/work/">McKinney Fellowship Bible Church</a> (in the Dallas area) and participates in the life of the church.</p>

<p><strong>Episode 4: New Age.</strong> An angry, skeptical salesman is exposed to various mediation and inner peace techniques.</p>

<p><strong>Episode 5: Abortion.</strong> A strong pro-choice woman spends 30 days living and working in a pro-life maternity home.</p>

<p><strong>Episode 6: Jail.</strong> Morgan himself spends 30 days in a jail in Virginia, including 72 hours in solitary confinement and 15-hour shifts in the kitchen.</p>
