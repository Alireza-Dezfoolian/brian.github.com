<p>The book made it's last stop on its journey and its first across the border. Jason Boucher, a pastor at <a href="http://www.lifecentre.org/">Lifecentre</a> in Ottawa, received his copy and had <a href="http://jasonboucher.typepad.com/jasonboucher/2007/01/what_i_like_abo.html">some kind things to say</a>.</p><blockquote><p>The biggest compliment I can give the book is that it helped me put <strong>language</strong> to what I have been doing without really knowing why. Language gives me both <strong>context</strong> and <strong>clarity,</strong> which are brilliant.</p></blockquote><p>He also loved the <em>Build a Better Blog</em> chapter and the tip to spend a lot of time reading blogs before you start blogging. <a href="http://jasonboucher.typepad.com/jasonboucher/2007/01/what_i_like_abo.html">Here's the full post</a>. <em>Thanks, Jason!</em></p>

<p>And with that, the Blogging Church Journey comes to a close. I hope you've enjoyed each of these different perspectives on the book. Here's where it landed over the past two months: <a href="http://www.perrynoble.com">Perry Noble</a>, <a href="http://www.garylamb.org/">Gary Lamb</a>, <a href="http://taddgrandstaff.com/">Tadd Grandstaff</a>, <a href="http://tallywilgis.blogspot.com/">Tally Wilgis</a> and <a href="http://www.benarment.com/history_in_the_making/">Ben Arment</a>. Thanks to everyone for being part of the journey!</p>
