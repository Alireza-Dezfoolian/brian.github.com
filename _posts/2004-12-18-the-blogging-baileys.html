<p>On Halloween, <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2004/10/halloween.html">I introduced</a> my <a href="http://bailey.typepad.com">wife Lori's weblog</a>. Over the past two months, she's continued to reveal that she is, indeed, a natural-born blogger!</p>

<p>Today I have the even greater pleasure of announcing <a href="http://bailey.typepad.com/ben">my son Ben's weblog</a>! He has been adding posts here and there for months with his unique brand of 9-year old boy expressiveness. I love to read his writing and discover the interesting things that capture his attention. He loves having his own site and the power to say whatever he wants. </p>

<p>Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's the <strong>Blogging Baileys</strong>! Our Christmas cards this year not only feature each of our weblog addresses, but direct you to Lori's&nbsp; site for the <a href="http://bailey.typepad.com/lori/2004/12/crossword_answe.html">answers to our Christmas&nbsp; crossword puzzle</a>. Merry Christmas from the Baileys!<br />&nbsp; </p>
