<p><a href="http://www.markbernstein.org/">Eastgate's Mark Bernstein</a> has written a <a href="http://markbernstein.org/Jun0401.html#note_35607">wonderful, short essay</a> on the inherent problems of weblog comments. Over the past year, I have gone back and forth on this issue, not because I have such a high traffic weblog that it's particularly relevant to me, but because I think it is a highly interesting, clearcut issue. Each side of the debate has, at least in my reading, persuasive arguments that reflect the highest aspirations of the web community..</p>

<p>My favorite point of Mark's is this:</p>

<blockquote>Because you can't ignore an insult in your own home, writers feel compelled to respond to pernicious claims that appear in threads they contribute to.</blockquote>

<p>His post is well worth reading. On the one hand, I have enabled comments throughout this site and have enjoyed the feedback I've received. However, if the comments became dominated by confrontational arguments or spam, I would be very hesitant to continue. </p>

<p><a href="http://scoble.weblogs.com/">Scoble</a> strikes me as someone with a completely opposite viewpoint than Mark. My impression is that Scoble accepts controversial and sometimes off-topic comments as a minor cost for the freeflow of ideas that his site generates. This is obviously a decision each person has to make based on the purpose of their site and the audience it serves.</p>
