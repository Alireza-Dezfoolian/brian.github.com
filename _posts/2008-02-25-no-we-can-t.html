<p>Matt Labash wrote a humor piece for <em>The Weekly Standard</em> about Obamamania. I was underwhelmed for most of it (though I did enjoy his description of "Yes we can!" as "something Jenny Craig affinity-groupers would chant before the weekly weigh-in"), but he definitely saved his best for the last paragraph: </p>

<blockquote>Plus, I do support Obama on the issue. Not issues, mind you. I'm against almost everything he stands for, including hope and change (I'm for despair and preserving the status quo). But he's for standing over the rotting carcass of Hillary's political ambitions, and so am I! Some might call it venal small-mindedness. But Obama and I call it "post-partisanship." For Hillary is the one we've been waiting for. To go away.</blockquote>
