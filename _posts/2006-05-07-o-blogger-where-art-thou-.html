<p>Thanks for your patience while my posts have been rather sporadic lately (<em>occurring at irregular intervals</em> according to the Oxford American Dictionary). I posted an <a href="http://www.bloggingchurch.com/home/2006/05/countdown.html">update on the book project</a> that's been consuming (<em>absorbing all of  someone's attention and energy</em> - aren't words cool?) my evenings and weekends on the <a href="http://www.bloggingchurch.com/">Blogging Church blog</a>. I'm down to the final month, so hopefully I will soon be able to return to a more consistent blogging rhythm. </p>

<p>Well, at least after the inevitable writing and technology-free vacation that is sure to follow the completion of the book :)</p>

<p>Hope everyone is having a wonderful Sunday!</p>
