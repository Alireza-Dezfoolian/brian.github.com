<p><a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=757">AppleInsider is reporting</a> with complete confidence that Texas will eventually gain its 5th Apple Store, and in one of the best shopping locations in my immediate vicinity: Southlake Town Square!</p>

<p>This will be a fantastic location for Apple. Southlake Town Square is a true shopping destination, with a number of great stores and restaurants and a very casual, community feel. Unfortunately, the store may be more than a year away.</p>
