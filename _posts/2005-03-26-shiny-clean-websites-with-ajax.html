<p>There is lots of development energy being spent on two relatively unknown pieces of web technology: Ajax and Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>Ajax is the name given by <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com">Adaptive Path's</a> founder Jesse James Garrett to the combination of technologies used so effectively in recent web projects, particularly <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a>, <a href="http://www.gmail.com">Gmail</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>.&nbsp; The list includes asynchronous javascript, CSS, XHTML, XMLHttpRequest and XML. Read his <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">great overview</a> for an introduction, then read <a href="http://www.ashleyit.com/blogs/brentashley/archives/000548.html">Brent Ashley</a> on the same subject.</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails is a technology that arose out of <a href="http://www.37signals.com">37Signals</a> and <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">David Hansson's</a> development of <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a>. The development team uses Ruby almost exclusively and built a new framework to take web apps in Ruby to the next level. Visit the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails site</a> for code, examples, and even a video walk-through.</p>

<p>And as you might have guessed, the two have been combined! Read <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000428.html">Ajaxing the Rails</a>.<br /> </p>
