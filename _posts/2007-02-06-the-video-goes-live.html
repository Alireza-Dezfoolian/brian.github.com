The great people at <a href="http://leadnet.org/">Leadership Network</a> launched the promotion for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">The Blogging Church</a> today with a video interview of Terry and I that gives a quick overview of blogging and the book. <a href="http://evotional.com/">Mark Batterson</a> even makes an appearance. <a href="http://www.pursuantgroup.com/leadnet/bloggingchurch/flashstory.htm">Check it out</a>.

</p>

<p>The video was announced through an <a href="http://www.pursuantgroup.com/leadnet/bloggingchurch/email_1.htm">email promotion that you can view online</a>, completely avoiding the risk of spam. Everything turned out very well and the team at <a href="http://www.pursuantgroup.com/">Pursuant</a> did an excellent job of pushing the video idea and pulling it all together. </p>

<p>The official press release and review copies are on their way as well. Knowing how much fun this part of the book process is certainly would've made some of those nights more enjoyable!</p>
