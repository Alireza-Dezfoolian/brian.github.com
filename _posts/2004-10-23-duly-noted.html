<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/TheNote/story?id=156238">The Note</a> is easily the best and most thorough daily summary of political news. In one place, you'll find links to every must-read and might-read article published in the last 24 hours. The writing is authoritative, entertaining, and, proving God's existence, available for free every morning! </p>

<p><i>The New Yorker</i> has published a <a href="http://newyorker.com/fact/content/?041025fa_fact">great profile</a> of <i>The Note</i> and the man behind it, Mark Halperin. The piece is about as long as you'd expect from a <i>New Yorker</i> profile, but well worth your time, especially the first half.</p>
