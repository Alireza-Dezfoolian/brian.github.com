<p>When I said that I currently have one other blog than this one, that wasn't <em>entirely</em> true. About a month ago, I started a third blog on the advice of someone I trust. <a href="http://wroxblog.typepad.com/minatel/">Jim Minatel</a> is an editor at Wiley and the man who helped make <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/047174719X/ref=pd_ecc_rvi_1/002-6472235-1816849?ie=UTF8">Naked Conversations</a> a reality. He's also the person who started the conversation that led to <a href="http://www.bloggingchurch.com/">The Blogging Church</a>.</p>

<p>He's <a href="http://wroxblog.typepad.com/minatel/2006/03/why_almost_ever.html">posted a few times</a> on his blog about the power of Amazon's new blog tool, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/arms/role/faq.html/ref=cm_arms_faq_all/002-6472235-1816849?ie=UTF8&amp;newWin=1&amp;view=all">AmazonConnect</a>, that allows authors to share their thoughts directly on the product page itself. In Jim's words, "It's a chance to talk to your customers in your own words at the point they're making their purchase decision."</p>

<p>I've started to see this more and more as I'm researching books and it has allowed me to get a better feel for the author. When Jim mentioned that these blogs now have <a href="http://wroxblog.typepad.com/minatel/2006/06/kudos_to_amazon.html">real RSS feeds</a>, I knew I had to give it a try. After all, how can a book on blogging not have a book blog on Amazon?</p>

<p>I don't know how many author blogs exist for books that are <em>currently not available</em> and won't be published for six months, but it can't hurt to get a head start, right?</p>
