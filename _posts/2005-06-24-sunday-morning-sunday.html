<p>We have received our wish...we do indeed live in interesting times.</p>

<p>Yes, Bono will be appearing on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032608/">Meet the Press</a> this Sunday, along with the Secretary of Defense. I have seen Bono give innumerable interviews, but I can't wait to see him sit down with Tim Russert for 30 minutes. Imagine the graphic designer sitting in his or her office, waiting for this week's assignment for the MTP graphic. &quot;I get to use Bono? Not Frist, McCain, Biden, Rice, or Carville? Bono? Really?&quot; I bet it was a nice change.</p>

<p>Bono will be discussing politics, poverty, and the AIDS crisis. The urgent cause currently is to drawn attention to <a href="http://www.live8live.com/">Live 8</a>, a series of concerts and a very well done web campaign to pressure leaders of the G-8 countries to take steps to end extreme poverty at their upcoming meeting, specifically:</p>

<ol><li>double the aid sent to the world's poorest countries,</li>

<li>fully cancel their debts,</li>

<li>change the trade laws so that they can build their own future.</li></ol>

<p>Add your name to the list <a href="http://www.live8live.com/live8/petition.do">here</a>.<br /></p>
