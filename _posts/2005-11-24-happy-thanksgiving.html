<p>Happy Thanksgiving to everyone! I hope all of you are having a wonderful day with family and friends. It's truly an amazing world we live in and a fantastic time to be alive. I'm so thankful for my family, for what I get paid to do everyday, where I get to do it and who I get to do it with. I'm so thankful for my friends and family, though many are far away. And I'm so thankful for all of you. I hope you have a blessed day filled with grateful hearts.</p>

<p>Our Thanksgiving is fairly simple this year. Lori is making an amazing dinner as she always does. We'll share our lists of things we're each thankful for, listen to a lot of beautiful music, light a few candles, and start our favorite holiday tradition, <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2004/11/start_your_own_.html">the book <em>Rascal</em></a>.</p>
