<p>Each year, O'Reilly hosts the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/">Open Source Convention</a>. Like open source itself, the convention features a number of different pieces of technology and conferences, including Linux, PHP, Postgres, and Apache.</p>

<p>While waiting for more information about this August's conference in Portland, O'Reilly's <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/nat/">Nat Torkington</a> has <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/04/on_conferences.html">posted some of the story</a> behind this year's theme: <strong>The Future is Open</strong>. </p>

<p>It also looks like the web technologies of the moment, AJAX and Ruby on Rails, will be heavily featured. Nat promises that registration and the full schedule will be online this week.</p>
