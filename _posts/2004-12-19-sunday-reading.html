<p>Two great Sunday reads:</p>

<p>First, President George W. Bush is named <a href="http://www.time.com/time/personoftheyear/2004/story.html">Time Magazine's Person of the Year</a>. The article does an excellent job of putting the election and Bush's surprisingly daring leadership style in perspective.</p>

<p>Second, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/19/business/yourmoney/19digi.html?hp&amp;ex=1103518800&amp;en=16f7002cdc5e0520&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage">New York Times covers the recent surge</a> in Firefox adoption by browser users everywhere. I personally use Firefox as my default browser on both Mac and PC and have found it to be flawless. The article includes some entertaining quotes form the Microsoft employee charged with responding to the challenge.</p>
