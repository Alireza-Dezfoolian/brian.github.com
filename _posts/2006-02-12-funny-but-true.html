<p>Since the <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2006/02/the_new_fellows.html">launch of the new website</a>, it's been fun to watch the traffic and various referrers. All of our sites now use a customized version of <a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/">awstats</a> and we have much better data than in the past.</p>

<p>One thing that is so funny to watch, though, is strange links from other church websites. We track when a request is made for a file on our server that cannot be found and since the launch, we've had a lot of these. A little investigation reveals something we've seen many times over the years - there are a lot of church websites <strong>that actually serve images directly from our server!</strong></p>

<p>Of course, designs and images are borrowed liberally across the web (how many Photoshop graphics start with a search of <a href="http://www.google.com/imghp?hl=en&amp;tab=wi&amp;q=">Google Images</a>?), but it takes it to a whole new level when you create a page that actually pulls live images from someone else's site.</p>

<p>You would be surprised at how many websites have large image not found messages on them this weekend because the links are no longer valid. I'm sure they'll discover them soon enough and then probably try to locate the images on the new site. Unfortunately, most are gone; we wanted a fresh start so about the only images we moved over were ministry logos.</p>

<p>It certainly doesn't cause us any harm and I wish them all the best, but it is funny to see. I wonder how often this happens in the corporate world? If you come across red x's this week on a church site, you might want to view the source, just for the fun of it.</p>
