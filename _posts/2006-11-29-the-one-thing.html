<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/0787984876&amp;tag=leaveitbehind-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">The Blogging Church</a> concludes with a chapter called, <em>The One Thing</em>. It may be my favorite part of the book, which is funny because I wrote less of it than any other chapter.</p>

<p>Here's the premise: I contacted some of my favorite bloggers and asked them to share the one piece of advice they would give another blogger. The result is 16 contributions from a diverse group of bloggers, from the man largely responsible for the blogging revolution to authors to church planters. There are believer and unbelievers, liberals and conservatives, A-Listers and, well, the rest of us.</p>

<p>The responses were as varied as the people themselves. Of course, very few could limit themselves to just one thing, so the contributions are packed with clever ideas and interesting perspectives. And just like the blogosphere, not all of them agree.</p>

<p>Each of these people was incredibly generous to contribute to the book and I can't thank them enough. Check out this list of top-flight bloggers and first-class people, visit their sites, and subscribe for a few weeks if you don't already. I've been reading some of these blogs for more than five years and through them learned most of what I know about blogging, and thankfully, a few other things as well.</p>

<p>I would never want to rank these, but I should state for the record that one contribution was indeed my favorite. When I read Julie Leung's piece for the first time, I immediately knew that it would be the last word and it is. I couldn't imagine a better way to end the book.</p>
