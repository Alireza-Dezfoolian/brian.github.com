<p>As if torn from the very pages of this blog, popular Apple rumor site <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0610red.html">Think Secret is reporting</a> today that Bono will be appearing on Oprah tomorrow and will use the occasion to debut the brand-new red <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">iPod nano</a>.</p>

<p>The red nano is part of the new <a href="http://www.joinred.com/red.asp">Red campaign</a> started by Bono. Red-branded products help raise money for women and children affected by HIV/AIDS in Africa. The tagline is "Designed to Help Eliminate AIDS in Africa".</p>

<p>This has absolutely nothing to do with <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2006/10/apple_buys_u2_f.html">what I wrote yesterday</a>. It's just a coincidence.</p>

<p>Really.</p>
