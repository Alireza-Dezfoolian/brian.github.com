<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>The official <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com/blog" target="FC"><strong>Fellowship Church Blog</strong></a> has launched!

</p>

<p>Visit <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com/blog" target="FC">fellowshipchurch.com/blog</a> or click the Blog link on the homepage. It is a great thrill to see the site come to life and to be part of a church that is always looking for new ways to reach people.</p>

<p>Our initial focus is just sharing information. With 10 services across 4 different campuses, it is easy to lose sight of all that God is doing here. We want to share the stories of life-change that are happening every week at Fellowship. </p>

<p>I know we'll learn a lot over the next few weeks about what works and what doesn't. Feel free to share your feedback.</p>
