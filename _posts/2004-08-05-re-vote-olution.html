<p>In case you have any doubt about how crucial the upcoming presidential election is, and how incredibly hard fought it is going to be, here are two terrific, passionate letters from people on opposite sides of the political spectrum, <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110005442">Peggy Noon</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/05/opinion/05bruce.html">Bruce Springsteen</a> [free registration required, or try <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2004/08/free_at_last.html">Bug Me Not</a>].</p>

<p>Both of these are inspiring examples of fair-minded, patriotic individuals who care about our country and want to do everything possible to make it a better place. The fact that they disagree completely doesn't change that. In Peggy's case, she is taking a 3-month leave of absence to help Republicans this fall as a volunteer, sacrificing her salary in the process. How many of us would be willing to take that leap?</p>

<p>Ask not what your country can do for you, ask  what you can do for your country!</p>
