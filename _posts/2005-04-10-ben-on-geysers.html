<p>My son Ben is finishing a very cool project. One of his big assignments this year has been researching a subject and producing a report and presentation. He completed all of the notetaking and finished the paper report, but next was the presentation. He had a number of options, but came up with a clever idea - a weblog!</p>

<p>His great teacher was game, so he created a weblog to serve as a fictional journal of someone researching geysers. He spent a long time working on it today and is nearly finished. He even figured out how to use <a href="http://images.google.com/">Google Images</a> and attach graphics in <a href="http://www.typepad.com">Typepad</a>.</p>
