<p>I found two interesting articles on potential presidential candidates this weekend.</p>

<p>Peggy Noonan on Barack Obama: <a href="http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110009388">The Man From Nowhere</a></p>

<p>The New York Times on Newt Gingrich: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/17/washington/17gingrich.html?ref=washington">Gingrich, on a Mission, Has No Time to Campaign for â€™08</a></p>

<p>I respect both of these men because they have the instinct to do something different - to address problems in new ways and have a more meaningful, more substantial debate. Of course, they are equally flawed and will likely succumb to the incessant pressure to approach the race in the same way as everyone else. I was always fascinated to read that Goldwater and Kennedy were considering making join appearances throughout the campaign where they would take part in a lengthy, civil debate. Unfortunately, they never had the chance. </p>

<p>It seems that most people agree that the national political process is supremely flawed, but every four years it returns, little different than before. I want a new campaign this time. Anyone else?</p>
