<p>During my mother's recent visit, I had the chance to look through family photos, something that is more entertaining every year. One photo in particular struck me. It showed my father and I sitting next to each other. I am smiling and looking at him (around 8 years old) and he is looking away while he plays his favorite Martin guitar.</p>

<p>The photo reminded me of a game we would often play (at least I thought of it as a game at the time).&nbsp; My father absolutely loved to play the guitar, particularly in the evenings and on the weekend. I would often run and sit next to him and watch him play. I would wait patiently for a brief pause where I could grab his attention and tell him my news, or show him my latest discovery, or ask him if he wanted to go outside.</p>

<p>Many times, though, minutes would go by without the slightest interruption. That's when I would <strong>put my hand on top of the strings, while he was playing</strong>, and attempt to prevent him from playing. He would laugh and enjoy the challenge of trying to play through the distraction, and I would laugh because it seemed like we were having fun together. But then my hand would get tired, I would let go, and, somewhat relieved, he would continue playing. I would often get up after a few more minutes and find another way to fill my time.</p>

<p>Now, my father had many amazing qualities and great moments, but I look back on that now and see how obviously I was attempting to say, &quot;Can you stop, just for a few minutes, put down your guitar, and give me your undivided attention?&quot;<br /> </p>

<p>And then I think about my 9-year old son.</p>

<p>And this wonderful Apple laptop.</p>

<p>And the number of times I've said, &quot;Just a few more minutes.&quot; </p>

<p>And the number of times he's said, &quot;It's been 20 minutes. You said it would be 10.&quot;</p>

<p>I think about the number of times I've listened while my eyes finished scanning the screen.</p>

<p>He deserves better. </p>

<p>It looks like I have my own guitar, and no more excuses.</p>
