<p>I've had some requests (you'll just have to trust me on this one) to combine my convention posts into one document for easier reading and sharing. Since I remain determined to keep all of my writing, no matter the subject, on one site, it can be a little distracting to transition from lengthy political essay to Pearl Jam lyric to Apple news.</p>

<p>So here it is, in convenient PDF form! <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/YouKnowWhereIStand.pdf">You Know Where I Stand</a>: Thoughts on the 2004 Republican National Convention. Feel free to share with friends or family or major media outlets.</p>
