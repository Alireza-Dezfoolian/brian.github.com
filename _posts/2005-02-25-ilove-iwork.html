<p>Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/">iWork</a> arrived today and it is fantastic. Within one hour, my son Ben took a GarageBand song he made, ran it through iTunes and dropped it into Keynote to play during a presentation. Then, he created a newsletter for his bi-weekly writing club, printed four copies and put them in the mail!</p>

<p>Ben's immediate verdict on Keynote? &quot;This is <em>so</em> much better than PowerPoint!&quot;</p>

<p>Good enough for me.</p>
