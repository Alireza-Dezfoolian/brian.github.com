<p>I arrived today in Austin for my third consecutive South by Southwest Interactive conference (<a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/">SXSW</a>). The Friday drive from Dallas to Austin was miserable in a typical sort of way. In fact, it was likely worse than in previous years because today also happened to be the beginning of spring break for most school districts. Though that made the drive a bit worse, it also meant that the family could join me for the first time. Lori and Ben will be visiting all of our favorite Austin sites, and some new ones, will I'm expanding my web knowledge.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to seeing what the vibe is this year. I'll post my thoughts on the sessions as time permits. Saturday's highlights are <a href="http://www.37signals.com">Jason Fried</a>, <a href="http://www.coudal.com/">Jim Coudal</a>, <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/">Andy Budd</a>, and <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">Kathy Sierra</a>.</p>
