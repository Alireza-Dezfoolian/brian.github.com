<p>1. Do you have any idea how funny <strong>Laser Hair Removal</strong> sounds to 10-year old boy obsessed with <em>Star Wars</em>? The sound effects alone made my weekend.</p>

<p>2. Wired Magazine profiled four body fat scales in the April issue. The title of the section? <strong>Chubby Checkers</strong>.</p>

<p>3. We used to own a Honda Civic. One night, the three of us were parked outside a friend's house where Ben was going to have a sleepover. Like any family, we began pretending that we were staking the joint. When the family arrived and turned on their porch light, we imagined them saying, "That's a <strong>specifically suspicious Civic</strong>!" </p>

<p>To this day, that phrase will provoke endless laughter. Try to say it five times fast. No, out loud! </p>

<p>4. Lori has her alarm clock set to play <strong>Clocks</strong> by Coldplay. As funny as that sounds now, it's slightly less funny at 6:00 am.</p>

<p>5. After watching and learning from <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37signals</a> for the past two years, I think we're finally ready to strike out on our own. On April 1st, we'll launch our new web development company, <strong>37psalms</strong>. Our first product is a sleek new chat application, similar to <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a>. The name? <strong>Kumbaya</strong>.</p>
