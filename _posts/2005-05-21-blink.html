<p>I just completed Malcolm Gladwell's latest book, <em><a href="http://www.gladwell.com/blink/index.html">Blink</a></em> and I highly recommend it. First, Gladwell's writing manages to be very informative and entertaining at the same time, which is a rare combination. He does an artful job of telling stories in such a way that you will return to them again and again long after you've finished the book. When I saw him speak at SXSW, I assumed that was because of his talent as a presenter, but now I see that it's how he layers and develops a story.</p>

<p>Second, <em>Blink</em> will open your eyes to how decisions are made. You discover that many factors influence our choices, whether we're consciously aware of them or not. Gladwell also shows why more information does not always improve the likelihood that we will make the right decision.</p>

<p>I love any book that makes you look at the world in a new and different way, and <em>Blink</em> definitely does that. </p>
