If you can trust the super-powerful, super-expensive inventory system of the world's largest retailer, then it appears that <strong>The Blogging Church is in stock for the first time anywhere!</strong> It's <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=5089225">available from WalMart.com</a> for $14 ($13.03 + just $0.97 shipping).&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>I think &quot;In Stock&quot; are my favorite two words after &quot;I Do&quot; :)</p>

<p>A bit more searching reveals that <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;EAN=9780787984878&amp;itm=1">Barnes &amp; Noble also shows the book to be in stock</a>, though at $17.95 before shipping and taxes, it's not exactly priced to move.</p>
<p>Since the book is available a full 2 weeks before the official publication date, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">Amazon</a> will hopefully be shipping copies to everyone who pre-ordered shortly. </p>

<p>Thanks for your patience throughout the endless updates and commercials. I can't wait to hear and read your feedback once it's finally in your hands!</p>
