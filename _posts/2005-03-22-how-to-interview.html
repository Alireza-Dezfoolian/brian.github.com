title: How to Interview

<p>Nearly six weeks ago, <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/02/the_bus_came_by.html">I announced</a> that Fellowship Church was looking for a web developer to join our team, and at last our search is over! God has truly blessed FC with a developer who has incredible skills and a servant's heart. Our <em>superstar</em> is also an expert in the <a href="http://www.terrystorch.com/2005/03/changing_our_wa.html">new development platform</a>, which I will write about in more detail soon.</p>

<p>After conducting a number of interviews for this position, I've gathered a few ideas for prospective employees that may help. After all, the goal is to get the job, right?</p>

<p><span style="color: #3333ff;"><strong>Want It</strong></span></p>



<p>This seems like a fairly basic idea. If you're interviewing for a position, it helps if you really <em>want</em> to work there. Oddly enough, this is not always the case. Many people seem to approach interviewing for a church position as if they're trying to determine whether to volunteer their time. </p>

<p>When I first interviewed at FC five years ago, my entire focus and
heart's desire was to be an employee, no matter the pay, position or
hours. We have employees from the largest corporations come on staff and regularly tell us that FC is one of the most challenging, demanding, and fast-paced environments they have ever experienced. If <em>all of you</em> doesn't want to be here, you won't last three months.&nbsp; <br /> </p>

<p><span style="color: #3333ff;"><strong>Do Your Homework</strong></span></p>

<p>You are interviewing for a web developer position. Do you even know how many websites we have? What is the development platform? Have you done any <a href="http://www.alexa.com">Alexa</a> searches to compare web traffic? Do you have anything constructive to say about the sites? Have you done a simple <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=brian+bailey">Google search</a> on the person who is interviewing you? </p>

<p><span style="color: #3333ff;"><strong>Say Thanks</strong></span></p>

<p>I've interviewed 20+ people over the past year (most applicants can be ruled out before the interview stage) and received less than 5 thank you notes, either written <strong>or via email</strong>! Again, you want the job desperately but you won't even take 5 minutes to thank the person for their time?</p>

<p>We don't settle when we hire. God doesn't call His church or His people to be halfhearted or second-best. He wants us to give everything we have to the cause, with passion and a heart for service.</p>

<p>My guess is there are more professional baseball players than there are full-time web developers in ministry. It is a phenomenal opportunity and responsibility, one that will challenge you like never before and change your life. </p>

<p>And it's worth your everything.</p>
