<p><a href="http://politicalwire.com/archives/2004/10/15/tracking_poll_update.html">Four new polls</a> were released today, three of which held great news for the President.</p>

<p>Bush 48% - Kerry 44% > Zogby<br />
Bush 49% - Kerry 46% > Rasmussen<br />
Bush 47% - Kerry 44% > TIPP<br />
Bush 48% - Kerry 48% > Washington Post/ABC</p>

<p>Here's the latest <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/oct/oct15.html">Electoral Vote Predictor</a>, which shows Bush with 284, a slim margin above the 270 necessary.</p>

<p>Why does it seem unlikely we'll be reading about a post-debate bounce for Bush?</p>
