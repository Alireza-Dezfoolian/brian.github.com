<p>I am thankful <br />that I'm incapable
<br />Of doing any good on my own

</p>

<p>'Cause by grace I have been saved
<br />Through faith that's not my own
<br />It is a gift of God and not by works
<br />Lest anyone should boast

</p>

<p>I'm so thankful <br />that I'm incapable
<br />Of doing any good on my own

</p>

<p>&gt; Caedmon's Call &gt; Thankful &gt; 40 Acres</p>
