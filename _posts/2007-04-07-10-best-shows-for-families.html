title: 10 Best Shows for Families
published: 1
---
<p>We love to watch television as a family. Though we greatly limit Ben's screen
time (television, computer, Wii) and Lori and I watch
<span style="font-style: italic;">The Office</span> and little else, we do have
fun sitting on the couch together and sharing a show. Through the beauty of
TiVo, we can grab all those episodes that are buried at 2am, meaning we always
have a collection of quality options to choose from.</p>
<h2>Top 10 Shows for Families</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Little
Bear</span><span class="link_to_edit_container"> (Age 3-5)<br />
One of our favorite shows of all time and the perfect first show for a young
child. Incredibly sweet, lovely music, and filled with imagination and kindness.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Anatole</span> (Age 4-6)<br />
A somewhat obscure cartoon about a mouse family living in Paris. Entertaining,
intellectual, and infused with an odd appreciation for culture considering it's
a show about mice.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Jimmy Neutron</span> (Age 6+)<br />
We saw the movie when Ben was 7 and have enjoyed it ever since. We laugh almost
as much as Ben and he loves the technology theme.<br />
<br />
</span><span class="link_to_edit_container"><span style="font-weight: bold;">SpongeBob
SquarePants</span> (Age 6+)<br />
Hilarious show that often reminds me of Monty Python. It seems that every child
in America watches this, so I don't have much to add. My only perspective is
that I would try to save it until they're a little older. Every age finds it
funny, but it's a very loud show that I think is better for school-aged kids.<br />
</span><span class="link_to_edit_container"><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Leave it to Beaver</span> (Age 7+)<br />
One of the best shows to watch with the whole family. The quality of the
writing, acting, and story-lines is very strong and there are endless, basic
lessons about life, growing up, and respect for parents. It's unfortunate that
the show is assumed to be simplistic and written off as irrelevant to today. In
the few cases where it is clearly dated, it's a great opportunity to talk about
how and why things have changed.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Green Acres </span>(Age 7+)<br />
I know this is a funny choice, but we started watching
<span style="font-style: italic;">Green Acres</span> about two years ago and loved
it. Just pure fun in a vaudeville way with running gags, misunderstandings, and
a talking pig.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Andy Griffith</span> (Age 7+)<br />
The humor and sense of values is the main draw, but my favorite part of the show
is its perspective. Andy never loses sight of what's important, he treats
everyone fairly, and clearly understands that who he is is more important than
his circumstances. The black &amp; white episodes are excellent, but I would
skip the color ones.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fetch </span>(Age 8+)<br />
Wonderful show on PBS that started last year. It's essentially an
adventure-filled game show with a great sense of humor for smart kids. I
</span><a title="wrote about it last year" target="blank_" href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2006/06/fetch_rules.html">wrote
about it last year</a><span class="link_to_edit_container"> and the second
season is around the corner.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Cosby Show</span></span> (10+)<br />
If I ever rewrite by
<a title="Top 10 Shows of All-Time post" target="blank_" href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/09/10_favorite_tv_.html">Top
10 Shows of All-Time</a>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Arrested
Development</span> will be replaced by <span style="font-style: italic;">The Cosby
Show</span>. I watched it when I was growing up and loved it, and his albums
were a huge part of my childhood and now Ben's, but I had no idea how good the
show was. A child will definitely enjoy it, but it's really made for parents.</p>

<p>
The show has sparked so many family conversations. It's perfect to watch with
children who are on the verge of junior high and high school. There is a lot
about dating, friendships, dealing with parents, and maturing in general
(physically and emotionally). Cosby used the show to introduce so many cool
people and so much cool music to a wider audience. The show had no hesitations
about being an example. Like Leave it to Beaver, there are elements that are
unrealistic, but what's wrong with a show that inspires rather than settle for
the lowest common denominator. There are many subtle aspects to this: the
parents are almost reading when they are relaxing, the television is almost
never part of family life (ironic, I know), the older generations are treated
with enormous respect and celebrated, church is a regular part of their lives,
work is highly valued, and romance is a huge part of a loving relationship.</p>

<p>
The parenting lessons are endless and better than most parenting books and
seminars. The show makes it abundantly clear that the most important
relationship in the house is the one between Cliff and Claire - everything else
flows out from there. Their relationship has so many lessons for couples, both
in how to respect and value one another, but also how to teach, train and love
your children with the understanding that real goal is to prepare them to leave.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Wonder Years</span> (12+)<br />
After searching for <span style="font-style: italic;">The Wonder Years</span> for
the past year, we were thrilled to see it start airing on a local channel last
week. (Quick aside: apparently, the reason the show is not available on DVD is
huge licensing issues - it used so much original music from that period and they
don't have the necessary rights to sell it in a new format.) I watched it in
high school and college and absolutely loved it. We were so eager to share it
with Ben and when we watched the first episode, I realized why. The show starts
with 12-year old Kevin preparing for his first day of junior high. Ben will turn
12 and start middle school in August.</p>

<p>
After experiencing family life from the parent's perspective with
<span style="font-style: italic;">The Cosby Show</span>, it's the perfect time to
see life through a child's eyes. Since <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Wonder Years</span> features a struggling family and takes place in the
tumultuous 60's and early 70's, there are definitely some challenging story
lines that are a little beyond Ben's age. Those are good opportunities for
conversations within the comfort of our family.</p>

<p>
I still believe that the less television the better, but if you're looking for
something to share with the whole family, one of these might be a good fit. If
you have any suggestions, I'd love to hear them.</p>
