<p>With Apple's recent release of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari 3 beta</a>, I decided to spend a week with Safari and see if I could make the switch. As much as I love <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a>, there some great, elegant touches in Safari that I miss from time to time. Plus, you can easily sync your Safari bookmarks with the iPhone, another nice incentive.</p>

<p>The result? Safari 3 is a really good browser. It is super-fast in my experience and a pleasure to use. There are definitely some bugs that cause a few sites to crash the browser, but I assume the final version released in <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/">October with Leopard</a> will address those. Nevertheless, after a week, I'm back to Firefox. Here's why:</p>

<p>10. After all these years, simple web features such as the TypePad HTML toolbar still don't work in Safari due to JavaScript issues.</p>

<p>9. Safari only allows you to pick software on your hard drive to manage RSS feeds, whereas Firefox allows you to choose <a href="www.google.com/reader ">Google Reader</a> and other web-based tools.</p>

<p>8. <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a> doesn't officially support Safari and it shows.</p>

<p>7. In Firefox's preferences, you can turn on the ability to start searching the page as soon as you start typing (and you're not in a form field). It not only saves a keystroke, but it's really fast and gets you want you want immediately. Safari's new Find is a big improvement, but still not as dead simple.</p>

<p>6. Firefox offers easy bookmark syncing between different computers through <a href="http://www.foxmarks.com/">Foxmarks</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/browsersync/">Google Browser Sync</a>. Apple wants you to subscribe to .Mac for the same ability.</p>

<p>5. You can block nearly every ad in the world with <a href="http://adblock.mozdev.org/">Adblock</a> and the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1136">Filterset.G Update</a> (thanks, Brad!). By default, Safari blocks no ads on pages and doesn't even consistently block all pop-ups. Sites that were usable in Firefox are nothing more than living, moving billboards in Safari.</p>

<p>4. The <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/firefox/extension">del.icio.us Firefox extension</a> that allows you to add bookmarks directly to del.icio.us from the browser is sweet.</p>

<p>3. The outstanding <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/en/chat.html">Google chat option in Gmail</a> isn't available in Safari. It would nice if Google would make that clear as it can take a long time to figure out why you don't have the &quot;Standard with Chat&quot; option in Gmail on Safari.</p>

<p>2. Firefox has great session restore, so if the browser does crash or get closed suddenly, you can often get right back to where you were.</p>

<p>1. If you work with the web for a living, there are many Firefox extensions that are essential, especially <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60">Web Developer</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843">Firebug</a>. Other favorites include <a href="http://www.kevinfreitas.net/extensions/measureit/">MeasureIt</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/271">ColorZilla </a>and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1557">QuickProxy</a>.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browse/type:1">hundreds more terrific extensions</a> that can make Firefox do just about anything you want and nearly all work on both Macs and PC's. If your primary browser is still Safari or IE7, <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/">Firefox is worth a try</a>.<br /> </p>
