<p>I went to Office Depot a week ago looking for a new notebook and left with a sleek new way to be organized. After being trained to simply <em>get what I came for</em> in all shopping experiences, I accidentally browsed and found myself buying things I had no intention of purchasing.</p>

<p>All of the notes I take and to-do lists I create in the physical world are temporary. I jot things down, add them to Outlook/Entourage or <a href="http://backpackit.com/?referrer=BPZZS">Backpack</a> later, and then tear out the page and throw it away. So this means I have no need for a high-quality, permanent notebook, just something decent and cheap.</p>

<p>Many of you are familiar with the Hipster PDA<a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda/"></a> phenomenon, which essentially replaces complicated, expensive, battery-swallowing PDA's and SmartPhones with, well, 3x5 index cards. I have always been intrigued by this, since technology isn't the answer to every problem, but had trouble picturing how it would work in the real world.</p>

<p>Until last week that is, when I came across a wonderful thing called <strong>The FranklinCovey Leather Index Card Holder</strong>. It not only has space to hold 10 index cards, but room for a small pen. What's really great (I didn't even see this until Ben pointed it out to me) is that it functions as a wallet as well. There's room for a driver's license, 3 credit cards, a couple of business cards and cash. All of this for $15 in a package only slightly taller than the typical wallet.</p>

<p>I picked up one of the <a href="http://www.spacepen.com/usa/index2.htm">Fisher space pens</a> because I'd heard good things about them and knew it would fit. Now, I have the ability to take notes anywhere on easily replaceable, cheap index cards and I've replaced my wallet as well. So far, it's been the best solution I've ever had.</p>

<p>Of course, <a href="http://bailey.typepad.com">Lori</a> could do a post about the <strong>$0 PDA</strong>, as she basically handmade her own day planner, but men have to spend <em>some</em> money in order to feel like they <em>saved</em> money.</p>
