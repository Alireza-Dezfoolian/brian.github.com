title: Where Do I Begin?

<p>This weekend, I added a section to the homepage called, <i>Where Do I Start?</i> I find that whenever I visit a weblog for the first time, I wish I had access to a representative sample of the writer's efforts. What typically happens is I scan the most recent few days of posts, but not much beyond that, which means that I'm judging months or years of writing on a week of work. So, I thought I'd provide a collection of essays that cover everything from politics to mega-churches to personal stories. Hopefully, this will make it easier for people to get a more complete <strong>first impression</strong>.</p>

<p>If anyone's curious, <i>Where Do I Start?</i> is a subtle homage to my favorite Chemical Brothers song, <i>Where Do I Begin</i>. The song has a single, repeating verse that concludes with <i>Where do I start? Where do I begin?</i></p>
