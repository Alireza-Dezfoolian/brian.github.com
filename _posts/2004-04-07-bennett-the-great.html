<p>Ben received raves from his piano teacher today, which is always nice to hear. He certainly works at it with energy and enthusiasm. I had a great time helping him with his math homework tonight, mostly 3 digit subtraction and long numbers... I so rarely get to do that. We then watched a baseball special together and he told Lori and I about his field trip to see a performance of <em>James and the Giant Peach</em>. What fun!</p>
