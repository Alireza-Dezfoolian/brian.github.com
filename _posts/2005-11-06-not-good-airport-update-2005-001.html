title: Not Good! AirPort Update 2005-001
published: 1

<p>On Thursday night, I was about to leave the office when I noticed there was an update available for my 12" PowerBook. The title was <strong>AirPort Update 2005-001, Version 1.0</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>This update fixes reliability and resolves AirPort compatibility issues with certain third party 802.11 cards and access points for Mac OS X v10.4.3 and later.</blockquote>

<p>This sounded like something useful, so I clicked install and minutes later it was done. Given the choice of rebooting or shutting down, I chose to shut down since I was on my way home. Every time I install an update, I always insist on rebooting just to make sure everything is fine, but I have learned to trust Apple over the past two years, so I skipped that step.</p>

<p>A few hours later, I turned on the machine and after 10 minutes was still staring at an Apple logo in the center of the screen. I tried two more times without any luck and finally tried to boot off of an OS disc, which didn't exactly work, but I was at least able to get to a login screen. I signed in and everything appeared to be functioning normally. </p>

<p><strong>Attention anyone who is unfortunately of the same intelligence as me or less:</strong> if your computer exhibits troubling behavior and then suddenly appears to be working, use every second that God himself has granted you to backup and copy every file you could ever need!</p>

<p>Lulled into a false sense of security, I proceeded to use the laptop as if nothing had happened. Two hours later, I went to save a file and couldn't. Then I tried to open a ZIP archive and couldn't. Next, I received the message that my startup disk was full and I should close all open applications. I finally rebooted only to be faced with the Apple logo once again. This time, there was no getting past it.</p>

<p>Our talented techs took a look the next morning and found keys out of order on the harddrive, as well as a corrupted Library folder. They were not able to mount the drive at all. I decided to take it to an Apple store, which I did yesterday.</p>

<p>The store techs were unsure of whether it was a hardware or software problem. However, when I mentioned the Airport update, <strong>they knowingly shook their heads and acknowledged that they had received reports of similar problems!</strong> In the end, after testing the harddrive further, they concluded that it was indeed a software problem, which means <strong>Apple's software update corrupted my harddrive and made it unusable</strong>.</p>

<p>The only option was formatting the harddrive and starting over. They gave me the chance to take it to a data recovery company, but I've seen those invoices before and knew that wasn't going to happen.</p>

<p>So, I now have a blank harddrive waiting for Tiger. As many of you know, this incident is a mere 92 days after <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/07/bad_apple.html">my harddrive had to be replaced</a>. This time, however, I lost everything, including a number of recently purchased iTunes songs that I hadn't even burned yet, my blog subscriptions and saved articles, some of my work on the <a href="http://www.bloggingchurch.com">Blogging Church book</a>, and other things that come to mind only as I drift off to sleep.</p>

<p><strong>Please be careful</strong> when you install the recent AirPort Update. And please, spend some quality time with your CD or DVD burner and save everything you can - you never know when you might lose what you have.</p>
