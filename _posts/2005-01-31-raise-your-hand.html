<p>Growing a volunteer ministry is currently a hot topic in the church world. There are <a href="http://www.willowcreek.com/product.asp?invtid=PR25066&amp;action=details">books</a> and entire conferences dedicated to the subject. In fact, the sessions on volunteering at our recent conference had over 300 people in attendance, something almost unheard of 3-4 years ago.</p>

<p>Why the interest? In my view, it is because church's have discovered that volunteering is as crucial to those serving as it is to the church. When a person volunteers, he takes ownership of his church and truly connects with the overall vision. The church, of course, benefits immensely; Fellowship Church could simply not function on a weekend without our incredible volunteers. However, when you get people plugged-in to serving, you are allowing them to become part of something larger than themselves, and there are few things more rewarding.</p>

<p>Our <a href="http://www.creativepastors.com">CreativePastors</a> team (<em>Full disclosure</em>: I happen to be married to a member of that team!) and Volunteer Ministry have developed a <a href="http://www.creativepastors.com/store/viewItem.phtml?productId=1151">Volunteer Kit</a> to address the question: How do we build a volunteer-driven church? The kit is a combination of resources which lay out the vision of volunteering and how to put it into practice, including many hands-on examples and sample materials.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.creativepastors.com/store/viewItem.phtml?productId=1151">Volunteer Kit</a> was released at the Creative Church Conference two weeks ago and we've been blown away by the response. Check it out, and see if it could benefit your church.</p>
