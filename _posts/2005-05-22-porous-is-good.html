<p>In case you missed it, Hugh at <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/">GapingVoid</a> posted a <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/001607.html">great summary on the power of blogs</a> within an organization.</p><blockquote><p>So how do you keep misalignment from happening?</p>

<p>The answer lies in &quot;x&quot;, the membrane that separates A from B. The more porous the membrane, the easier it is for conversations between A and B, the internal and external, to happen. The easier for the conversations on both side of membrane &quot;x&quot; to adjust to the other, to become like the other.</p></blockquote><p>Don't miss the <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/001607.html">entire post</a> to get the full picture. Hugh even includes a helpful visual aid as well.</p>
