<p>The sun struggles up another beautiful day<br />
And I felt glad in my own suspicious way<br />
Despite the contradiction and confusion<br />
Felt tragic without reason<br />
There's malice and there's magic in every season</p>

<p>> Elvis Costello > Other Side of Summer > Mighty Like a Rose</p>
