<p>Former President Bill Clinton has been conducting a number of interviews this week to promote the paperback edition of his book. There have been some interesting comments, particularly about Hillary in '08, Bush, and Newt Gingrich. Here's the transcripts from <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0506/01/lkl.01.html">Larry King Live</a> and <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,158706,00.html">Fox News</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a quote from CNN...</p><blockquote><p>This idea that somebody we disagree with on economic or social policy
or something we have to turn into some kind of ogre or demon, I think,
is a mistake. I mean, it's like telling the American people or half the
American people that don't agree with you they're all fools. That's
just not true.</p></blockquote><p>And one from Fox...</p><blockquote><p>If two people have good minds and they’re looking at problems, if they agree all the time it means one of them is not thinking. If they disagree all the time, it means one of them is not thinking. They’re just allowing their political position to dictate their position on an issue. And I think that’s unhealthy. And the public knows better.</p></blockquote><p>Both parties are relentless in this and until the approach begins to fail, we can expect more of the same. Politics has been dumbed down to sandbox simplicity - &quot;Mine&quot;, &quot;Stop it!&quot;, &quot;I'm telling&quot;, &quot;He started it!&quot;, &quot;She's lying&quot;.</p>
