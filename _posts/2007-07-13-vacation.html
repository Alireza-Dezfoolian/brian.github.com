<p>Early tomorrow, I'm leaving to spend a week in Colorado with my beautiful bride to celebrate our 15th anniversary! I first started researching this vacation in November as it was largely a surprise. You wouldn't believe how many destinations were in the mix. I think I finally found the perfect location for us and a fantastic place to stay. I've been revealing bits and pieces of the plan to Lori over the last two weeks.</p>

<p>I won't be posting this week, but there will be a few updates here and there - just visit <a href="http://twitter.com/bb">twitter.com/bb</a>. I've been using <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a> for months and really love it. For something so incredibly simple (140 character updates on what you're doing), it still takes awhile to get a feel for it.</p>

<p>Everybody uses it differently, including <a href="http://twitter.com/BarackObama">presidential</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/johnedwards">candidates</a>. I love it for updates, brief thoughts, and quick links. You can also send and receive updates through your phone. If you don't want to visit <a href="http://twitter.com/bb">my twitter page</a> to see the latest, you can always view them right on <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com">my blog homepage</a> through a handy <a href="http://everything.typepad.com/blog/2007/07/twitter-typepad.html">new TypePad/Twitter widget</a>. More on twitter in a future post.</p>

<p>If you haven't tried it, <a href="https://twitter.com/signup">create a free account</a> and add me as a friend. Experiment with it for awhile - there are some <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/06/27/twittergramsDay5.html">cool things</a> being <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/04/28/twitterAsCoralReef.html">built around it</a>. If you already twitter regularly, post your address in the comments.</p>

<p>Have a great week!</p>
