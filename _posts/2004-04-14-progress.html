<p>Today was a long day that I'm happy to say ended well. We had another great time at the ballpark watching Ben, and he rewarded us with his second double in two games! It was another great hit down the left-field line that nearly reached the fence. He also made the second-to-last out on a great play at pitcher. His team is now 5-0.</p>

<p>And late in the evening I finally finished the requirements document that has been weighing on me for the past week. Of course, calling it a requirements documents does a disservice to requirements documents everywhere, but it was my best attempt at summarizing an upcoming software project. I am comfortable admitting I was completely out of my comfort zone with this project; I'm thrilled to be moving on to the actual development process.</p>
