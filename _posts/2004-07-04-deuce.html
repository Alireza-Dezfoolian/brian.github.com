<p>Ben and I watched our first two tennis matches this weekend, the men and women's finals at Wimbledon. I have been a fairly consistent fan since I was watching John McEnroe as a teenager and trying to imitate his serve, even though I am right-handed. Well, fan in only the laziest definition, as in watching the last 2 or 3 matches of Grand Slam events.</p>

<p>Ben has played tennis a couple of times in the past few months with his friend, Alex. We have yet to actually play together, but I'm hoping to get him a racket soon and start having fun. I love playing tennis and have missed it over the past couple of years.</p>

<p>There are few things stranger than explaining tennis scoring to someone for the first time. I need to find a good resource that explains the reasoning behind the madness.</p>

<p>I think Ben really enjoyed watching the matches (they were both better than any I've seen for quite awhile). Of course with Ben, sometimes it's hard to tell... I don't know where he gets that! </p>
