<p><a href="http://www.familyreads.com">We Baileys love books</a>, but we also love watching movies. This summer, we thought we'd have fun with a weekly summer movie. Each week we'll choose a guilty movie treat - funny family films to watch with our 12-year old son that are just pure enjoyment. A few are consistent favorites, but we'd also like to include some new ones. It helps if they have a summer theme, but that's not required. What is required is that they be ridiculously entertaining. </p>

<p>Here's a list of movies under consideration so far. Feel free to steal a few for your own summer movie festival, but then share some of your ideas in the comments - we'd love to hear them!</p>
