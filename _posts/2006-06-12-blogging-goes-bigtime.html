When a blogger leaves a company and the news is worthy of the <a href="http://www.wsj.com">Wall Street Journal</a> homepage. Word spread yesterday that <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/06/11/the-geeks-on-saturday-night/">Robert Scoble is leaving Microsoft</a> for a position with a Silicon Valley start-up, <a href="http://www.podtech.net">PodTech.net</a>. In fact, the story was ranked higher than a fresh wave of violence in Baghdad. The news is also in the print Journal this morning.</p>

<p>Congratulations, Robert, on your fresh start! It's great news that you'll be closer to your son, and I know you'll do incredible things at PodTech!</p>

<p>Now, I just need to edit about three stories in the book :)</p>
