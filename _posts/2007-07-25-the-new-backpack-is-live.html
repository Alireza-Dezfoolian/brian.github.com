<p>The new version of <a href="http://backpackit.com/?referrer=BPZZS">Backpack from 37signals</a> is now live. <a href="http://www.backpackit.com/new">Check out the overview of the improvements</a>, including some great video walkthroughs. </p>

<p>They have also increased the amount of file storage for each plan while keeping the prices the same - 500MB, 1GB, and 3GB. <em>Very nice!</em></p>
