<p>The Bailey's spent much of the 4th of July weekend enjoying an assortment of movies. Here's my take.</p>

<p><a href="http://matchstickmenmovie.warnerbros.com/">Matchstick Men</a></p>

<p>Lori and I both loved this movie. It was unique throughout, avoided cliched plot twists, and left us perplexed until the very end. Nicholas Cage gives a great performance.</p>

<p>This was much better than I thought it would be. All three of us loved it. Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt were both terrific. Even though it's primary purpose was laughter, the movie managed to make a few well-placed points about family priorities. This was definitely a case where the previews failed to capture the film.</p>

<p>Seeing Garfield involved a fun trip to the theatre with Ben and one of his friends. The highlight was hearing the two of them giggle throughout. Even though Roger Ebert loved it, I still was surprised at how enjoyable it was. There were a couple of forced parts, by Bill Murray is so much fun to listen to as a cat that it's easy to ignore them.</p>
