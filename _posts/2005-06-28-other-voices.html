<p>I've <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/02/uncomfortable.html">written often</a> about the wonderful ability of blogs to expose us to different perspectives. As we read other opinions and voices, we gain greater understanding and appreciation for those that don't think exactly like us. <em>I know you voted for Nader, but you love Arrested Development too? Cool!</em></p>

<p>The best expression I have heard of this was Barack Obama's speech at last year's Democratic National Convention (<a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=BhVzT*D2F0k&amp;offerid=78941.450204274&amp;type=10&amp;subid=">free iTunes download</a>). This is an incredible speech no matter your political preference.</p>

<p>How do we do this, though? How many of us will search out people who don't think like we do, and take the time to listen to what they have to say?</p>

<p>I thought I would try an experiment. I am opening up my blog to guest posts from people who have different opinions or beliefs; people who don't think like I do. One of the greatest dangers I see with blogs is how easy it is to <strong>subdivide ourselves into micro-communities of people who think, act, and look alike</strong>. I notice the warning signs when I see comments filled only with affirmation and agreement. </p>

<p>Obviously, a community of like-minded people is a wonderful thing, but it can also lead to stagnation if it impedes change and growth.</p>

<p>Who better to introduce this experiment than <a href="http://www.misterorange.com/">Evan Erwin</a>. I came across Evan just over a year ago and we started an <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2004/06/peace_through_s.html">interesting conversation</a>. He is a passionate, talented writer with a great family. He also has beliefs very different from my own. Look for Evan's post tomorrow.</p>
