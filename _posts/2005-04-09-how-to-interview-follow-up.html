<p>There have been some interesting <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/03/how_to_intervie.html#comments">comments on my <em>How to Interview</em> post</a>. Some have suggested that my expectation of a thank you note following an interview is unreasonable as it infers that you are doing someone a favor by hiring them. The thank you note has also been called a gimmick!</p>

<p>First of all, I was not suggesting that you send a thank you note after the decision has been made to hire someone else (although it can't hurt to continue building your network even when you are turned down). All I was referring to was common courtesy.</p>

<p>The comments imagine a hiring process where the only thing that matters is the resume and a simple Yes/No based on qualifications. That couldn't be further from the truth. Typically, I am trying to decide between a number of similarly qualified people. What is going to be the determining factor? A number of things - desire, positive attitude, gratitude, love of learning, heart for ministry (in our case), and many more intangibles.</p>

<p>My son is currently playing soccer, as is the daughter of a friend, who is known as the best player on her team. We were recently discussing how good this young girl is and her mom said, &quot;You know, the fact is, she isn't really better or worse than the other girls, and she definitely isn't the fastest. <strong>She just wants it more</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>Some people can stake their career on skill set alone because of their level of talent. If so, terrific. Otherwise, you are trying to make the case that you should be hired over a number of other people, and I would do everything I could to make that choice an easy one.</p>
