<p><a href="http://wufoo.com/">WuFoo is wonderful</a>. What is it? A dead simple way to create online forms.

Plus, the website, design, and copy writing are first-class, too. <a href="http://wufoo.com/examples/ ">Check out some examples</a> of what you can do with WuFoo. <em>Highly recommended!</em></p>
