<p>Last Friday, I stepped through the doors of an <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_US/">IKEA store</a> for the first time. Our house actually has a number of things from IKEA already, thanks to some hefty shipping fees and my wife's trips to Houston, which was where the closest store was. A few months ago, they opened a <a href="http://www.ikea.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/IkeaNearYouView?storeId=12&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=10103&amp;StoreName=frisco">brand-new IKEA in Frisco</a>, which is about 30 minutes from here.</p>

<p>The web team is currently moving to a new office and we were tasked with fitting five people in an average-size office. Since computer people love large, simple, and deep tables more than the normal drawer/keyboard tray packed desks, I immediately thought of IKEA.</p>

<p>It was a great trip. We found some awesome, inexpensive, desks that fit perfect in our room. In fact, we've already moved into our new office and absolutely love it. The shopping experience was first-rate and we got a lot of personal help.</p>

<p>I was going to write a fascinating post about all the neat things you can learn from IKEA, but Mark Batterson already did it for me. Mark is the pastor of a very cool church in DC. <a href="http://blog.theaterchurch.com/2005/12/ikea.html">Check out his post on 7 Ideas from IKEA</a>.</p>
