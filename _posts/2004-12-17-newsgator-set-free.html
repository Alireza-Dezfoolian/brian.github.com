<p><a href="http://www.newsgator.com/home.aspx">Newsgator</a> now offers its slick <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/ngs/default.aspx">online edition</a> for free! Newsgator makes a terrific Outlook edition that allows you to integrate RSS with your email. I used the product for nearly an year without problem. Only my move to the Mac (and <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a>) for my reading and writing pulled me away.</p>

<p>I have experimented with the online version and I must say it compares very well to its main, free, online competitor, <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>. It is a bit more intuitive and I find the interface more appealing. You can read all of your unread posts in a single, date-sorted view. The Web Edition is also an interesting example of a full ASP.NET site.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there are a few missing pieces. I noticed right away that you have the choice of viewing <em>current</em> posts (read or unread) or <em>older</em> posts. Unlike Bloglines, you cannot choose different time frames such as one day, week, or month.</p>

<p>Newsgator Web Edition is definitely worth experimenting with. Import your subscription list (OPML) and give it a try. Thanks to Scoble <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/12/16.html#a8899">for the news</a>.</p>
