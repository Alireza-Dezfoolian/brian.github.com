If you follow this blog through Google Reader or another RSS tool, check the address you're using. If it's http://feeds.feedburner.com/LeaveItBehind, please remove that feed and switch to [http://brianbailey.me/atom.xml](http://brianbailey.me/atom.xml). The FeedBurner feed will end next week.

I'm removing all third-party elements from my publishing process, as well as anything that provides another number to track. [More about that later](/2011/10/29/the-validation-generation/).

To sum up: http://feeds.feedburner.com/LeaveItBehind will be removed next week, so update your subscription to [http://brianbailey.me/atom.xml](http://brianbailey.me/atom.xml). 

Many thanks!
