<p>I spent a fair amount of time searching for just the right name for this weblog. And though I won't bore anyone with a list of the alternatives (though albeitstuffy.com was a late entry...kidding), I should at least explain what the name means to me.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2004/05/todays_lyric_2.html">Today's Lyric</a> reveals, I found the phrase originally in my favorite song of the past two years, <em>Walk On</em> by U2. The song is so wonderful and has so many incredible lines that I have played it over in my mind hundreds of times. The first moment when it went from a great song to a defining, fabric-of-my-life-type song was when it was performed at Fellowship as part of a fantastic message.</p>

<p><em>Home… hard to know what it is if you've never had one<br />
Home… I can't say where it is but I know I'm going home</em></p>

<p>A few months after that, I purchased the two live concert DVDs from the recent tour and was blown away by what the song had become, a show-closing anthem of celebration, complete with a lovely Hallelujah chorus.</p>

<p>So, that is what the song means to me, but it still doesn't address what the title means to me. <em>Leave It Behind</em> as the banner for this weblog symbolizes two things. First, the pursuit of the spirit of that song, letting go of everything in the here and now, all of our struggles and inadequacies, and clinging to the eternal. </p>

<p>Second, it describes so simply what I am doing here, in this space.</p>
