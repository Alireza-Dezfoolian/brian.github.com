<p>Joel Spolsky has written a terrific article on the purpose of coding standards: <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Wrong.html">Making Wrong Code Look Wrong</a>. If you are involved in software and web development, this is Joel at his best. The goal is to:</p><blockquote><p>deliberately architect your code in such a way that your nose for uncleanliness makes your code more likely to be correct. This is the real art: making robust code by literally inventing conventions that make errors stand out on the screen.</p></blockquote><p>As a bonus, he explains the difference between <em>System</em> and <em>Apps</em> Hungarian notation and makes a strong case against both abstraction and exceptions.</p>
