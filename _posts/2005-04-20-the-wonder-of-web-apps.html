<p>Evan Williams of <a href="http://www.odeo.com">Odeo</a> on <a href="http://www.evhead.com/2005/04/running-your-company-on-web-apps.asp">Running Your Company on Web Apps</a>. </p>

<p>Great post by Evan on the beauty of hosted applications that allow you and your team to focus on what they do best. From email to project management to customer service, the complete Odeo infrastructure is accessible from anywhere in the world via an internet connection. Additionally, the small team or company does not have to waste time installing, maintaining, and upgrading multiple applications.</p>

<p>There will always be cases where the benefits of an internally hosted or custom-built solution is preferable, but when in doubt, look to the web.
