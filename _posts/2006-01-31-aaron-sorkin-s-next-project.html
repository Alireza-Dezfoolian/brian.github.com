<p>According to <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/television/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001919660">The Hollywood Report</a>, we can plan a watching a brand-new drama from Aaron Sorkin and Thomas Schlamme this fall. NBC purchased the rights to the hour-long show about the behind-the-scenes world of a sketch-comedy show. The team used a similar premise for the fantastic <em>Sports Night</em>. Hopefully, this will help ease the pain of those mourning <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2006/01/west_wing_cance.html">the recent cancellation</a> of <em>The West Wing</em>.</p>

<p>Matthew Perry from Friend's just agreed to play the lead in the new show.</p>
