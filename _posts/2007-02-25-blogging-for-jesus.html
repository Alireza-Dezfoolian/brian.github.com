<p>Just thought I would pass along a link to my favorite blogging pastor of late, <a href="http://www.stevenfurtick.com/">Steven Furtick</a> of <a href="http://www.elevationchurch.org/">Elevation Church</a> in North Carolina. I first learned of Steven from <a href="http://taddgrandstaff.blogspot.com/2007/02/elevation-church.html">Tadd Grandstaff</a>, and then Steven came to <a href="http://www.creativepastors.com/conferences.php">C3</a> this weekend. If I had come across him earlier, I definitely would have included Steven in the book.</p>

<p>Elevation is just a year old and already reaching over 1,200 people each weekend. If you read his blog, you'll get an idea of why. Steven is 100% sold-out to Christ and the vision he's been given for Elevation. He is over-the-top passionate, funny and unwilling to be distracted from the only thing that matters - reaching the lost. I can't imagine how someone could read his blog for a week and not want to check out the church. The energy, joy, and honesty is infectious. And more than anything, Steven promotes Jesus, not himself.</p>

<p>Here are some of my favorite posts...</p>
