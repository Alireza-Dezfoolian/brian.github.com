<p>The book made a stop at the home of <a href="http://www.benarment.com/history_in_the_making/">Ben Arment</a>, talented blogger and pastor of <a href="http://www.historychurch.org/">History Church</a> in Virginia. I'm a big fan of Ben for three reasons. First, he shares the name of the greatest 11-year old in the world. Second, he loves U2 as much as I do. And third, he's a political junkie of the &quot;<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0312848/">Journeys with George</a> was good, but <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0108515/">The War Room</a> will always be my favorite&quot;-type.</p>

<p>Ben actually is one of the contributors to the book, so you never know how that might cloud someone's judgment. Here's an excerpt of <a href="http://www.benarment.com/history_in_the_making/2007/01/the_blogging_ch.html">what he had to say</a> [emphasis entirely his own]:</p><blockquote><p>I literally read this book in<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span><strong>one hour</strong>. I've never read a book that fast in my life, but it was really <strong>well written</strong> and <strong>covered the scope</strong> of blogging without dragging. I'm a bit beyond the <strong>blogging primers</strong>, which are in abundance at bookstores, so it was nice to read one that didn't <strong>walk me through</strong> setting up a Typepad account.</p>

<p><strong>Brian knows his stuff</strong>, and it was great to read about his connections with some of the top <strong>tech bloggers</strong> in the nation. [Brian is an extremely likeable guy on <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/">his blog</a>; someone I'd love to have dinner with.] <strong>Innovators</strong> in the <strong>church world</strong> are drawing the attention of <strong>innovators</strong> in the <strong>marketplace</strong>. This book documents it.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm glad the book is an easy read and all, but the thought that I took a year to write what someone read in an hour is a little disconcerting :)</p>

<p>Ben goes on to make a great point that the book could have been called &quot;The Blogging Pastor&quot; since there are very few successful church or team blogs. He's right about that - the best blogs are almost always the voice of a single person. This is a good time to mention that my preferred title was <strong>Blogging Church</strong>, without &quot;The&quot;. I liked how &quot;blogging&quot; could serve as both an adjective and a verb in that phrase, and I especially liked the verb version. The publisher&nbsp; didn't insist on much, but they were adamant about the &quot;the&quot;. They thought the other way was confusing. In case anyone is interested or is working on a new and improved version of this book, the working title was &quot;The Miracle of Blogging&quot;.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to post your thoughts, Ben. I'm up for dinner anytime!</p>
