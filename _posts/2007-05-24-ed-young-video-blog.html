<p>Earlier this month, Ed Young started a cool <a href="http://www.creativepastors.com/vblog.php">video blog</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/edyoungministries">YouTube channel</a>. It's been great watching these behind-the-scenes videos where Ed gets to share what's on his mind in a very informal way. The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YDvYSgn8FA">first video</a>, where he discusses the struggles and challenges of ministry, has already been viewed over 3500 times. </p>

<p>There are so many fun and interesting ways to use technology to communicate, and new ones come online all the time. For instance, video blogging is barely mentioned in <em>The Blogging Church</em> and that came out just five months ago.  I can't wait to see what's next!</p>
