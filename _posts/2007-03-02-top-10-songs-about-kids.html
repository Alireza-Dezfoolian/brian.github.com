title: Top 10 Songs About Kids
published: 1
---
<p>Some of my favorite songs are songs about kids. There's something very moving when rock stars write sweet songs about their children. I think part of it is I love to find those things that connect very different people and being a parent is one of them, no matter how dissimilar we are. </p>

<p>So, here are my <strong>Top 10 Songs About Kids</strong>. The full lyrics are just a click away. I've also <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewIMix?id=217932648">created an iTunes iMix</a> where you can sample all of the songs.</p>

<p><strong>10. <a href="http://benfolds.bluni.com/display.php?songid=3">Still Fighting It</a> by Ben Folds</strong></p>

<p>Ben Folds has written one song about his son and another about his daughter. This one is about his boy and even though it's a bit sad, it still talks about a feeling I think every parent has at times. You realize your child is going to be a lot like you and that's not always a good thing.</p>

<blockquote><p>You'll try and try and one day you'll fly<br />
Away from me
</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>9. <a href="http://www.u2.com/music/lyrics.php?song=449&amp;list=s">Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own</a> by U2</strong></p>
<p>This song is from the other perspective - a son writing about his father.</p>

<blockquote><p>Listen to me now<br />
I need to let you know<br />
You don’t have to go it alone<br /><br />

And it’s you when I look in the mirror<br />
And it’s you when I don’t pick up the phone<br />
Sometimes you can’t make it on your own</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>8. <a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/g/grateful+dead/row+jimmy_20062517.html">Row Jimmy</a> by Grateful Dead</strong></p>
<p>Unlike the rest of these songs, most people would not list this one as being about a child. As we know, everyone hears songs differently depending on your life and where you are at the time. For me, though, this song has always had a parent's feel. The music itself is so lovely and the lyrics paint a picture in my mind of a sleepy night on a front porch, sitting next to your boy or girl and talking about the day's adventures (or vee-ventures, as Ben used to call them).</p> 
<blockquote><p>Julie catch a rabbit by his hair<br />
Come back step, like to walk on air<br />
Get back home where you belong<br />
and don't you run off no more</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>7. <a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/l/lauryn+hill/to+zion_10163236.html">To Zion</a> by Lauryn Hill</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a cheat, as this is more Lori's song than mine. Nevertheless, the music and words are amazing. I don't know if she's listened to this yet without getting tears in her eyes.</p>

<blockquote><p>Now let me pray to keep you from<br />
The perils that will surely come<br />
See life for you my prince has just begun<br />
And I thank you for choosing me<br />
To come through unto life to be<br />
A beautiful reflection of his grace<br />
For I know that a gift so great<br />
Is only one God could create<br />
And I'm reminded every time I see your face</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>6. <a href="http://www.woodyguthrie.org/Lyrics/Hoodoo_Voodoo.htm">Hoodoo Voodoo</a> by Wilco</strong></p>

<p>Two of the best CDs I own are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mermaid_Avenue">Mermaid Avenue Volume 1 &amp; 2</a>. On these albums, Wilco and Billy Bragg perform Woody Guthrie songs that were never recorded. In fact, they existed only as lyrics. </p>

<p>Woody wrote this incredibly fun and completely nonsensical song for his children. Wilco turn it into something that will put a smile on anyone's face.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hoodoo voodoo<br />
Chooka chooky choochoo;<br />
True blue, how true;<br />
Kissle me now.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>5. <a href="http://www.u2.com/music/lyrics.php?song=130&amp;list=k">Kite</a> by U2</strong></p>
<p>Like the other U2 song, this one is about a father and son. It's about that moment at the end of your father's life when you know time is short. You want him to see you for who you are, but you also want to say, &quot;I know that this is not goodbye.&quot;</p>
<blockquote><p>I'm a man, I'm not a child<br />
A man who sees<br />
The shadow behind your eyes
</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>4. <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/GDead/AGDL/take.html">I Will Take You Home</a> by Grateful Dead

</strong></p>

<p>Written and performed by keyboardist Brent Mydland, this song causes me stop whatever I'm doing and listen to it the moment I hear it. Beautiful.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ain't no fog that's thick enough to hide you<br />
Your daddy's gonna be right here beside you<br />
If your fears should start to get inside you<br />
I will take you home<br />
I will take you home<br />
Gonna carry you back home in my arms<br />
I will take you home
</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>3. <a href="http://www.phish.com/viewers/index.php?ID=335&amp;rid=2&amp;type=lyrics">Billy Breathes</a> by Phish</strong></p>
<p>One of my absolute favorite songs, sung almost in a whisper. As you listen, you are transported to a quiet car on a long drive, your child asleep in the backseat.</p>
<blockquote><p>Silent scenes<br />
In motion means<br />
I’ll wake you when we’re there<br />
Oh sing softly<br /><br />

Time, it seems<br />
In broken dreams<br />
To sleep beside the stair</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>2. <a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/songs/PonyBoy.html">Pony Boy</a> by Bruce Springsteen</strong></p>
<p>I used to sing this song to Ben when I was putting him to sleep. I don't remember singing any other songs, just this single, perfect one.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ride with me ride with me<br />
Won't you take a ride with me<br />
Underneath the starry sky<br />
My pony boy
</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>1. <a href="http://benfolds.bluni.com/display.php?songid=238">Gracie</a> by Ben Folds</strong></p>

<p>A couple of years later, Ben Folds had a daughter, Gracie, and wrote a wonderfully sweet song about her.</p>

<blockquote><p>And you will always have a part of me<br />
Nobody else is ever gonna see <br />
Gracie girl
</p></blockquote>

<p>What are the songs that have meant a lot to you or that you've shared with your children? I'd love to hear them!</p>
