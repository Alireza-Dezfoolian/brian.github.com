title: Looking for Talent

<p>If you love web design and development, we're looking for talented people to work on some incredible projects at <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com">Fellowship Church</a>. Right now, we have four websites and four campuses that we want to take to the next level. If you've been following along, you know we made a major shift last April to open source, linux-driven development. We're cranking out some sweet code left and right, but we need designers to take that code and make it shine. Read all about our <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/08/have_a_cup_of_c.html">development approach here</a>.</p>

<p>Three priorities? <strong>Push-the-envelope web designers, top-shelf Flash artists, and people neurotic about good UI.</strong></p>

<p>Three bonuses? PHP/scripting knowledge, database experience, and a some serious photography skills. </p>

<p>We have lots of possibilities that are still being finalized, but it's time to start searching. We're looking for some <strong>volunteers</strong> with a passion for service, some <strong>contractors</strong> with a passion for cash and working on high-profile sites, and possibly some <strong>employees</strong> with a passion for ministry and Fellowship Church.</p>

<p>If you're interested or know someone who might be, leave a comment or send me an email (brian at leaveitbehind dot com). Take a chance. It may seem crazy right now, but God can do some amazing things with crazy.</p>
