<p>We'll soon be off to Colorado for a vacation and though we are in now way roughing it, I did come across this <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000482.php">great recommendation</a> from Kevin Kelly's <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/index.php">Cool Tools</a> site for a well-done survival pack. If we ever do a more adventuresome trip, I would definitely like to have one of these along with us.</p>
