<p><a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/06/15/rss.html">RSS: The Next Generation</a> by Giles Turnbull on <a href="http://www.oreilly.com">O'Reilly</a>. Syndicated summaries of web content are more popular than ever before, and the recent explosion of users has prompted some dramatic changes in the world of RSS software. Giles Turnbull takes a look at some of the latest offerings, including PulpFiction, Shrook, and of course, NetNewsWire.</p>

<p>This is an excellent article. I currently use NetNewsWire, but look forward to trying the alternatives.</p>

<p>Also, the <i>Blog this</i> link within every O'Reilly article is fantastic. The link takes you to a page that provides the text and html for you to cut and paste into your blog, as seen above. I can think of a number of good uses for this feature.</p>
