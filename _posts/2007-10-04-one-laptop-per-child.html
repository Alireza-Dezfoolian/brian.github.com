This group has been working for years to create a low cost, innovative, and incredibly durable laptop that could be used by children in the developing world. It looks like they've succeeded.</p><blockquote><p>The truth is, the XO laptop, now in final testing, is absolutely
amazing, and in my limited tests, a total kid magnet. Both the hardware
and the software exhibit breakthrough after breakthrough â€” some of them
not available on any other laptop, for $400 or $4,000.</p></blockquote><p>The laptops cost approximately $200 and feature so many robust, terribly clever features that you'll have to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/04/technology/circuits/04pogue.html?ex=1349236800&amp;amp;en=2f1e04ab391cc5f7&amp;amp;ei=5124&amp;amp;partner=permalink&amp;amp;exprod=permalink">read about it</a> to get the full picture. The software itself is entirely open source and is written to encourage interaction and programming.</p>

<p>In order to guarantee a strong launch and as much attention as possible, the organization is making the laptop available to the more fortunate among us. <a href="http://www.xogiving.org/">Starting on November 12</a>, you can purchase two laptops for $400, one for yourself and one to donate to a child in the developing world. This is a brilliant move that is sure to be successful. You can do a good deed and still be able to play with one of the most original pieces of technology in a long time. <a href="http://laptop.org/">Learn more</a>.<br /> </p>
