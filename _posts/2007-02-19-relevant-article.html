<p>I'm finishing an article for the <a href="http://www.relevantnetwork.com/">Relevant Leade</a>r this week that will be published in the spring issue. The Leader is part of the <a href="http://www.relevantnetwork.com/">Relevant Network</a> and is done by the same people who create <a href="http://relevantmagazine.com/">Relevant Magazine</a>. I was honored to be asked and it's been a fun project to work on.</p>

<p>The folks at Relevant were very flexible. The basic request was for a piece about how blogs can be used as a ministry communication tool. I was tempted to go the excerpt route and repackage a section of the book, but that felt a little like cheating. Besides, I thought I must have something new to say on the subject in the six months since I turned in the final draft.</p>

<p>So, I've approached the piece as an extension or addendum to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">the book</a>, especially the chapters "Warning Labels" and "Built to Last". The general theme is that blogs are good, but they could be so much more. They are not a good thing in and of themselves. Like any tool, a blog can be harmful or misused, and can distract you from what God has called you to do. I know because I've faced these challenges myself. I'm writing about three areas that can cause problems and how to get past them. </p>

<p>I hope to be able to publish the article here soon. My working title is "Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile". You'll see why when you read it!</p>
