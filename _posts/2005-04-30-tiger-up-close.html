<p>The best part of each Apple operating system release is the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10.4.ars/1">in-depth review by John Siracusa</a> for Ars Technica. You will not find a more thorough look at the OS anywhere, whether in print or online.</p>

<p>John's <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10.4.ars/1">review of Tiger</a> spans 21 different sections, including many hard-core developer topics like the underlying kernel and file metadata. <em>Highly recommended!</em></p>
