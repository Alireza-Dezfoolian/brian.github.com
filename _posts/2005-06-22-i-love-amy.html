<p><a href="http://amylovesbooks.blogspot.com/">Amy Loves Books</a> is one of my absolute favorite weblogs. A teacher, Christ-follower, and mother of two, she writes with great openness and honesty.</p>

<p>This past week, Amy has written extensively on <a href="http://amylovesbooks.blogspot.com/2005/06/big-bad-wolf.html">public schools</a>, <a href="http://amylovesbooks.blogspot.com/2005/06/failing-schools.html">homeschooling</a>, <a href="http://amylovesbooks.blogspot.com/2005/06/no-child-left-behind.html">No Child Left Behind</a>, <a href="http://amylovesbooks.blogspot.com/2005/06/poverty.html">poverty</a> and at-risk children. What is so refreshing is that these posts are not written from a political point of view but from her life. Two years ago, she and her family moved into Atlanta's inner-city where she teaches in, and her children attend, the local schools.</p><blockquote><p>They [her students] are the least of these. They are hope-sick. I know that they feel
like everyone in society is against them, because they come right out
and articulate those feelings. <br /><br />I am not saying that it is
wrong for parents to send their kids to a high-achieving school, or a
private school, or to home school. I am simply saying that if we, as a
church and as the body of Christ, choose to educate our own children
outside of public education, we need to be aware of the children left
behind.</p></blockquote><p>Amy's posts are such a fantastic example of the power of weblogs. Whether you are writing for yourself, your circle of friends and family, or hundreds or even thousands of curious strangers, there is amazing freedom in the ability to tell your own story, the way you want to tell it.</p>

<p>If you are a parent of school-aged children, don't miss these posts.</p>
