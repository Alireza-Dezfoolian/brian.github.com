<p>My son Ben is working on a great school project. He has to choose 12 people for his ideal get together. They can be alive or dead or even characters from fiction. So far, Thomas Jefferson, Harry Potter, Ben Franklin, Jesus, and Obi-Wan Kenobi have made the list.</p>

<p>We had so much fun talking about this over dinner, I couldn't resist putting together a list of my own. I decided to stick with living people to help narrow the field. </p>

<h2>My Dream Guest List</h2>

<p>Now, let's hear some of your names...</p>
