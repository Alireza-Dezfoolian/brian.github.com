<p>On Tuesday, we found out that Ben has been chosen for the Leap enrichment program at his school! We are so thrilled! He has been in Leap most of his first two years, but this is the first time that it is official. He has had to take innumerable tests over these years and we are so proud of him for doing so well and not giving up. We believe this means that he will be in the program for the rest of his elementary years, which makes all of us very happy. Hopefully today will be his first day and he will have exciting news to report.</p>

<p>To celebrate his achievement, he choose Sonic for dinner (as always) and we enjoyed a Family Movie Night with Holes. It was completely different than I expected, but really very good and highly original. Definitely recommended, at least for older children.</p>
