<p>I received word yesterday from Jossey-Bass that early next month, <em>The Blogging Church</em> will enter its second printing! Orders for the book have been very strong and the publisher has been impressed by the response so far.</p>

<p>Orders have been so good, in fact, that as of this morning, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">Amazon is officially out of stock</a>. I know multiple distribution centers are expecting shipments soon, but you can order online from <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;EAN=9780787984878&amp;itm=1">Barnes &amp; Noble</a> or <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=5089225">Wal-Mart</a> in the meantime. Both mainstream and Christian bookstores are beginning to stock the book as well, so you may find it in your own neighborhood. </p>

<p><em>Update: As of this evening, the book is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">back in stock on Amazon</a>.</em></p>

"It is the perfect book for church leaders who are wanting to learn how to use blogs to enhance their ministry but don&rsquo;t know where to begin." <a href="http://churchrelevance.com/2007/02/16/the-blogging-church-by-brian-bailey-and-terry-storch/">Read the full review</a>.</p>
