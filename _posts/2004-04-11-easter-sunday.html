<p>Today was such a wonderful rarity - a long, peaceful day at home with just the three of us. We had a wonderful Easter Sunday together as a family, filled with great food, conversation, reading and warmth. Ben enjoyed his Easter basket, including the traditional pack of baseball cards.</p>

<p>I have to admit that it was not only holy and serene...we did watch <a href="http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/tradingspaces/tradingspaces.html">Trading Spaces: Home Free</a> in the evening!</p>
