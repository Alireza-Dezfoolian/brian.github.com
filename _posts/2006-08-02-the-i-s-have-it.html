<p>Thanks for all of the <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2006/07/the_index_quest.html">great</a> <a href="http://www.bloggingchurch.com/home/2006/07/the_index_quest.html">feedback</a> on whether <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/0787984876&amp;tag=leaveitbehind-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">The Blogging Church</a> should include an index. The comments were overwhelming in favor of an index and so when the book is published in January, you'll find an index right where you'd expect! Without your votes and persuasive arguments, I most likely would've turned down the index, so you guys really made a difference.</p>

<p>Of course, all of you who voted for an index are now contractually obligated to purchase the book since it will indeed have an index. Just submit your receipts for verification and I'll update your records :)</p>

<p>Thanks again for the help!</p>
