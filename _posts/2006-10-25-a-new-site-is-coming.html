<p>The book writing process is officially over and the final edits are complete! In fact, I won't see the book again until it's printed and shipped in January. Of course, I've already thought of a couple of things I wish were in there but aren't, but I'll be sharing those periodically as the release date nears.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I thought this would be a good time to do some work on <a href="http://www.bloggingchurch.com">BloggingChurch.com</a>. The site has been a great help during the writing process, and hopefully people have learned a few things along the way. Terry recorded some <a href="http://www.bloggingchurch.com/home/podcast/index.html">terrific podcasts</a> that were enlightening, entertaining, and provided some great content for the book. The comments and feedback were also helpful.</p>

<p>Now, I'd like to continue that conversation here. As I've mentioned before, I think it's best to pour your writing and ideas into a single blog if at all possible. I don't recommend simply duplicating content into two different locations, especially since many of you subscribe to both blogs already. </p>

<p>In the next couple of weeks, BloggingChurch.com will transition into a site dedicated to the release of the book. In addition to the required information about how to actually buy it, there will be links to the blog archive, this blog and Terry's site, and other resources. Two of these resources are already live - a <a href="http://brianbailey.backpackit.com/pub/784948">page featuring many blogging pastors and church leaders</a> and a <a href="http://brianbailey.backpackit.com/pub/784928">page collecting comments, press, and eventually, reviews</a> of the book.</p>

<p>Stay tuned over the next few days for some fun updates about the book.<br />
