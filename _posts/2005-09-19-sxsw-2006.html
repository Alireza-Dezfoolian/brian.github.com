<p>The next edition of <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com">South By Southwest</a> is only six months away and this weekend I received my first promotion in the mail. I've attended SXSW in Austin the past two years and enjoyed it greatly. It is definitely one of the best conference values you can find anywhere and the <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/">Interactive Conference</a> gets bigger and better every year.</p>

<p>This year, they're finally taking my advice and giving 37signal's <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/bits_n_bytes/pivot/entry.php?id=26">Jason Fried a keynote spot</a>! His sessions have been the highlight of the past two years and now he gets the big stage. He'll be sharing it with <a href="http://coudal.com/">Jim Coudal</a> (please click that link - it's quite a site).</p>

<p>Craig Newmark (<a href="http://www.craigslist.com/">craigslist</a>) and Kathy Sierra (<a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Creating Passionate Users</a>) are two of the other confirmed speakers and there will be many more big names over the next few months. Definitely worth checking out.</p>
