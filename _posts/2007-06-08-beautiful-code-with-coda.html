<p>The wonderful Mac software development company <a href="http://www.panic.com/">Panic</a>, builder of the FTP app <a href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a>, has released a brand-new program - <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">Coda</a>. <strong>It's the best new software I've used in a long time.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.panic.com/coda"><img width="450" height="154" border="0" alt="Coda" title="Coda" src="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/images/2007/06/08/coda.jpg" /></a><br />
Coda is a web development tool that brings all of the common web tools together in a single program and a single window. Within Coda is an <strong>text editor</strong>, <strong>CSS editor</strong>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">terminal client</span>, <strong>SFTP client</strong> and <strong>built-in preview</strong>. The price for all this programming goodness? <strong>$79</strong>. I have been using it for three weeks and fall more in love with it every day. The first week was a challenge as I adjusted to some new ways of doing things, but once I got comfortable, I don't think I could go back.</p>

<p>A fair assumption is that any app that combines so many different tools will be average at best - that by being a jack-of-all-trades, it will by definition be a master of none. I have no doubt that there are limitations to this approach, and I've run into a few, but the benefits, the pleasant surprises, and the sheer beauty of the software more than make up for any.</p>

<p>My favorite feature makes it easy to setup a site profile that stores everything you need to work on a specific website. If you work with multiple sites, this makes it easy to jump from one to the another. </p>

<p>Right now, I would say all of the core pieces of Coda are better than average, but what's so exciting is that it is constantly getting better. The frequent fixes and new features make it clear that what is truly great now is going to be fantastic in the future. They already have my money. If you do web development on a Mac, take a couple of days and <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">give it a try</a>!</p>

<p>Even if you have no interest in the software, visit <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">the website</a>, browse through the features, and take a look at the checkout process. Panic builds excellent software, but their website is honestly even more impressive. They set the standard for simplicity, elegance and a first-class buying experience.</p>
