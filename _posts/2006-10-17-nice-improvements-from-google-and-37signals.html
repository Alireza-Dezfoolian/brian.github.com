title: Nice improvements from Google and 37Signals

<p>Two of my favorite web apps are getting a fresh set of improvements. The first is <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google's newsreader</a> for reading blogs and other RSS feeds. The original version was quite nice, but I eventually drifted back to my favorite desktop newsreader, <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/NetNewsWire.aspx">NetNewsWire</a>. After hearing <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/10/11/i-love-google-reader/">Scoble rave</a> about the <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2006/09/something-looks-different.html">recent upgrade</a>, I decided to give it another try.</p>

<p>All I can say is, Wow! It's very, very impressive. I've used it exclusively for a week and couldn't be much happier. The overall design and speed are huge improvements, and there's a number of friendly customization options that just make it more fun to use.</p>

<p>One of things I love is the excellent mobile access. From my cell phone, I can visit the Google Reader page and read the latest posts and star (flag) them for later reading. Since it's just a mobile version of the actual page, there is no syncing or anything - the changes are live. Google also makes it easy to create a link blog of items you want to share. I'll be playing with that soon.</p>

<p>Whether you've never used a tool to make blog reading easy or you are looking for an alternative to <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a>, definitely give <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a> a try. </p>

<p>The second set of improvements are not actually here yet, but they're coming soon. <a href="http://37signals.com/">37Signals</a> is <a href="http://backpackit.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=6668">releasing some new features</a> for <a href="http://backpackit.com/?referrer=BPZZS">Backpack</a>, my favorite tool. Backpack also has <a href="http://www.backpackit.com/weblog/archives/new_features_updates/backpack_mobile_is_here_just_add_mob_to_the_end_of_your_backpack_url.php">terrific mobile access</a>, by the way. </p>

<p>They are previewing some of the new stuff through demos - <a href="http://backpackit.com/example_movies/bpwo-reordering/">the first one was just released</a> and shows how organizing a packed Backpack page is about to get much easier.</p>

<p>The demos are worth watching even if you have no interest in <a href="http://backpackit.com/?referrer=BPZZS">Backpack</a> - they're extremly well done. Short, clear, and to the point. And a wonderful example of how your marketing should match your products which matches the culture of your company - they are all one and the same.</p>
