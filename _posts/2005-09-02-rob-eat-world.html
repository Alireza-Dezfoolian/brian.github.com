<p>Two weeks ago, I received a comment on my post, <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/08/graceland.html">Graceland</a>, about Rob Bell's new book <em>Velvet Elvis</em>. The comment was from Zach who mentioned that he had recently done an interview with Rob that I should check out.</p>

<p>

I subscribed to Zach's blog right away, <a href="http://www.findingrhythm.com/weblog/index.php">Finding Rhythm</a>, because it was clear he has a lot of interesting things to say, but I still hadn't made it to the interview.</p>

<p>

I finally made time to listen and it is well worth your time. It's a very relaxed, casual conversation on a number of different topics. What I found particularly interesting is that the talk spends a lot of time on music, including great perspectives on music in church, something you don't usually hear pastors speak about.</p>

<p>

Why the music focus? Not only is Rob a huge music fan and musician, but Zach is none other than Zach Lind, the drummer for <a href="http://www.jimmyeatworld.com/main.php">Jimmy Eat World</a>.</p>

<p>

Sometimes blogs are so cool. <a href="http://www.findingrhythm.com/weblog/archives/archive_2005-w32.php#e82">Listen to the interview</a>.</p>
