<p>With Lori leaving for her weekend shopping trip, Ben and I were able to spend an entire day together. It's hard to believe how rare that is for us. He had an early baseball game, which just happened to include team pictures as well. Unfortunately, they lost their first game of the season, but it was a very close game.</p>

<p>We watched a terrific PBS documentary called <a href="http://www.pbs.org/smallball/">Small Ball</a> together. We both loved it. The movie follows a California Little League all the way to the Little Leage World Series. Though the kids were older, and the level of play much higher, we were still struck by the many similarities with his team today, from the players to the parents to the coaches. <em>Highly recommended</em>.</p>

<p>Next, we went to church, which included the launch of our brand new series; Forgiveness - The Real F Word. It was a well-done, enthusiastic service. We also volunteered for the first time with the Jr. High Ministry, delivering signs to the homes of first-time visitors. Ben loves it for a lot of reasons, but especially the name, Strike Force!</p>

<p>And finally, we visited a Honda dealership to compare the CRV and the Element. We left with little doubt that the Element is the vehicle for us, especially when I saw the smile on Ben's face after I mentioned the possibility of going on a camping trip and sleeping <strong>in</strong> the Element!</p>
