title: Building a Better Blog

<p>During four months of writing this weblog and years of following weblogs in general, I've accumulated a number of tips that have helped me in the daily challenge to build a better blog. Hopefully, they'll be of help to others as well.</p>

<p><strong>Use categories</strong></p>

<p>If you publish all of your writing to one location, but regularly write on a wide variety of topics, do your readers a favor and utilize categories. This will allow an interested reader to quickly view all of your posts on network security, while avoiding the day-by-day emotional swings of your child's soccer season.</p>

<p><strong>Use titles</strong></p>

<p>As much as possible, title your posts. This works best when your posts are fairly original and somewhat lengthy, but can be ignored if your blog is primarily links to other sites and posts. The benefits are two-fold. First, Google seems to place a large value on titles, especially when others link to a post. Second, your readers who follow your site using a news reader/aggregator will appreciate being able to quickly scan your titles for posts of interest.</p>

<p><strong>Publish during high traffic times</strong></p>

<p>If one of your desires is to generate traffic, try to publish during high traffic hours. Many people scan weblogs.com and other services (including Typepad and many Typepad member sites) for recently updated weblogs. Also, publishing during prime waking/working hours will give other writers time to comment, link, or respond to your post.</p>

<p><strong>Syndicate your entire post</strong></p>

<p>Again, in the never-ending effort to ensure happy readers, be sure to syndicate (i.e. send) your entire post through RSS. I follow over 75 weblogs (which is probably a low number on average). With the amount of time it takes to keep up with the constant stream of information, it is a great benefit to be able to read each post in its entirety without a separate trip to the browser. I know it is especially tempting for businesses to try to drive traffic to their site by forcing readers to visit the website in order to read the full article, but inevitably I end up unsubscribing from those sources instead.</p>

<p><strong>Click your own links</strong></p>

<p>When you post an article that links to other post or blogs, be sure to click those links after you post. First, this simply verifies that your links work, which is always a good QA check. Second, this will cause your site to show up in the stats and referrer logs of the sites you link to. Most bloggers track their traffic and referrers religiously, so this will make sure they are aware of your post as soon as it's been published.</p>

<p><strong>Develop an authentic voice</strong></p>

<p>Obviously, this is the most important element of a successful weblog and a daily struggle. If you are authentic, honest, and original, you will find readers who care about what you write. And if you write about what you know and what you are passionate about, you can assure that your readers are informed <i>and</i> entertained. Resist the temptation to imitate your favorite weblogs.</p>
