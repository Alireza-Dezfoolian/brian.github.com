<p><a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/02/one_way.html">Debates</a> are good, but I'll take <a href="http://aproverbs31woman.blogspot.com/2005/02/guest-blog-my-testimony.html">life change</a> every time.</p>

<p>In the end, it all comes down to this: a person is lost, invited to church by a friend, spoken to by the Holy Spirit through the message and the music, bows the knee to Christ, and is never, <strong>ever</strong> the same.</p>

<p>There have been literally thousands of these stories at Fellowship Church over the past 15 years. Praise be to God for the miracle of salvation through his Son.</p><blockquote><p>
What once was hurt<br />
What once was friction<br />
What left a mark<br />
No longer stings<br />
Because Grace makes beauty<br />
Out of ugly things (U2 &gt; <a href="http://www.u2.com/music/lyrics.php?song=136&amp;list=g">Grace</a>)</p></blockquote><p><em>Thank you, Lord, for the incredible opportunity to serve you in the local church.</em></p>
