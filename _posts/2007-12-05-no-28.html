<p>I noticed this morning that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">28th review of The Blogging Church</a> had been posted on Amazon. That was a nice surprise. More significant, though, was what the reviewer, Lisa Colton, had to say:</p>

<blockquote>I work with synagogues, and found the approach of blogging for "ministry" can be useful and much more broadly defined than for churches alone. Very easy to read, full of practical examples.
</blockquote>

<p>I love hearing about the creative ways the book is being used. Though the focus is certainly on evangelical churches, I'm glad to know that others have found it helpful as well. Thanks again to Lisa and everyone else who has taken the time to post a review or send feedback!</p>
