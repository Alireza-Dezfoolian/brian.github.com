<p>If you want to generate an RSS feed for your website, but are not using a content management system, <a href="http://www.softwaregarden.com/products/listgarden/">ListGarden</a> is a great option. The software, by Dan Bricklin, is free and runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.</p>

<p>With ListGarden, you create newsfeeds and then add new posts as needed. You choose where to store the XML file, which becomes the URL of your feed when located on a web server. </p>

<p>The tool is simple to use and works very well. It is very handy for generating internal feeds that are infrequently updated, such as staff announcements and department news. We're also testing ListGarden for our ministry newsletters, open to anyone, to provide another option other than email. </p>
