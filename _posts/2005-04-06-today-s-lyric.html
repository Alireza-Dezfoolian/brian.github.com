<p>Take these shoes<br />
Click clacking down some dead end street<br />
Take these shoes<br />
And make them fit<br />
Take this shirt<br />
Polyester white trash made in nowhere <br />
Take this shirt <br />
And make it clean, clean<br />
Take this soul<br />
Stranded in some skin and bones<br />
Take this soul <br />
And make it sing</p>

<p>
Yahweh, Yahweh<br />
Always pain before a child is born<br />
Yahweh, Yahweh<br />
Still I’m waiting for the dawn</p>

<p>
Take these hands <br />
Teach them what to carry<br />
Take these hands<br />
Don’t make a fist<br />
Take this mouth <br />
So quick to criticise<br />
Take this mouth<br />
Give it a kiss</p>

<p>
Yahweh, Yahweh<br />
Always pain before a child is born<br />
Yahewh, Yahweh<br />
Still I’m waiting for the dawn</p>

<p>
Still waiting for the dawn, the sun is coming up<br />
The sun is coming up on the ocean<br />
This love is like a drop in the ocean<br />
This love is like a drop in the ocean</p>

<p>
Yahweh, Yahweh<br />
Always pain before a child is born<br />
Yahweh, tell me now<br />
Why the dark before the dawn?</p>

<p>
Take this city<br />
A city should be shining on a hill<br />
Take this city<br />
If it be your will<br />
What no man can own, no man can take<br />
Take this heart<br />
Take this heart<br />
Take this heart <br />
And make it break</p>

<p>&gt; U2 &gt; Yahweh &gt; Vertigo</p>
