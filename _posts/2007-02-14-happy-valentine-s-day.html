<p>One year ago: <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2006/02/valentines_day.html">Valentine's Day with <em>Mad About You</em></a></p>

<p>This year, Lori and I celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary and the 20th anniversary of our first date! It was during our junior year of high school. I like to point out that our son Ben is just 5 years from the age I was on our first date. Lori doesn't seem to like hearing that, though.</p>

<p>We celebrated Valentine's Day on Sunday with a trip to the <a href="http://dallassymphony.com">Dallas Symphony</a> (a breathtaking experience featuring <a href="http://www.hilaryhahn.com/">Hilary Hahn</a> and a phenomenal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Rachmaninoff">Rachmaninoff</a> piece) and dinner at one of our favorite restaurants. Thank you, Lori, for allowing me to spend every day with the single most amazing, beautiful woman in the world!</p>
