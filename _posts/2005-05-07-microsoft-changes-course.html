<p>It's official - Microsoft has changed course on the recent anti-discrimination controversy. For details, read <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/05/06.html#a10008">Scoble's announcement</a>, <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=65966#65966">Steve Ballmer's email</a> to Microsoft employees, and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/07/national/07gay.html?ex=1273118400&amp;en=a61ef4fa41c9a045&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">New York Times</a>. For background, <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/04/scoble_microsof.html">here is my post</a> on the initial debate started by Scoble.</p>

<p>In the email, Ballmer said:</p><blockquote><p>After looking at the question from all sides, I've concluded that diversity in the workplace is such an important issue for our business that it should be included in our legislative agenda.</p>

<p>I respect that there will be different viewpoints. But as C.E.O., I am doing what I believe is right for our company as a whole.</p></blockquote><p>Hundreds, if not thousands, of employees and customers voiced their opinion on this issue, but there is no doubt that Scoble's original post intensified the debate and brought significant pressure and publicity.</p>
