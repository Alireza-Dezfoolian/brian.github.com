title: Great Organizations Remove Barriers
published: 1

<p>Every successful organization searches relentlessly for what is
standing in the way of its customers. If you want your product to be
used or purchased, you must discover what is preventing your customers
from doing so and <strong>remove those barriers</strong>.</p>

<p>Apple is easily the best current example of this. Over the past two
years, the company has completely altered its methodology, which had
relied primarily on the exclusivity of its products, to focus on
pleasing the consumer. <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/mwsf05/">Last week's keynote</a> was the final, triumphant
step in this transformation.</p>

<p><strong>Barrier</strong> &gt; Aging operating system without broad appeal,
lacking support for open standards, and difficult to integrate with
other networks and systems.</p>

<p><span style="color: #3333ff;"><strong>Solution</strong></span> &gt; Build <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Unix-based OS</a> with support for most open standards.</p>

<p><strong>Barrier</strong> &gt; Little public knowledge of Apple products and poor sales experience.</p>

<p><span style="color: #3333ff;"><strong>Solution</strong></span> &gt; Build over <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/">100 Apple Stores</a> in prominent cities and locations throughout the world, where the full customer experience is completely controlled. </p>

<p><strong>Barrier</strong> &gt; PC users unable to take advantage of the iPod and iTunes Music Store.</p>

<p><span style="color: #3333ff;"><strong>Solution</strong></span> &gt; Build a PC-version of<a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/"> iTunes</a>, opening the iPod to the majority of computer users and leading to a dominant market share.</p>

<p><strong>Barrier</strong> &gt; The iPod is too expensive, with the cheapest model at $249.</p>

<p><span style="color: #3333ff;"><strong>Solution</strong></span> &gt; Build the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">iPod Shuffle</a>, available for only $99.</p>

<p><strong>Barrier</strong> &gt; The iMac is too expensive and requires you to purchase a display you may not need.</p>

<p><span style="color: #3333ff;"><strong>Solution</strong></span> &gt; Build the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac Mini</a>, available for only $499.</p>

<p>Apple has removed nearly every barrier or objection a person could
offer. They have come to the conclusion as an organization that they
are not satisfied with selling to existing customers. </p>

<p>These decisions have had an enormous impact on
the image of the company, which is no longer viewed as an exclusive
club (complete with t-shirts that read <em>It's an Apple thing...you
wouldn't understand</em>), but as a responsive, inviting company offering tools to
enhance your life.</p>

<p>Well done, Apple. There are other organizations that come to mind, but what about the church? That is the topic of my next post.<br /> </p>
