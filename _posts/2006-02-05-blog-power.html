<p>I love to see the search results the bring people to this blog. I search for information constantly and know well the joy of finding exactly what I was looking for and the frustration when every link is a dead end. For instance, you'd be surprised at how often people search for information <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/12/when_is_a_sleep.html">about sleepovers</a>. The person I felt the most sorry for was the one who was looking for &quot;gifts for political science majors&quot; and <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2004/11/what_if_politic.html">ended up here</a>.</p>

<p>One simple blog rule is that the title of your post matters <em>a lot</em>. If the title of your post matches a common search phrase, people will find your site on a regular basis. Now, I honestly have no desire for this kind of traffic; I'm not tracking eyeballs, running Adwords or anything. The number of readers I have matters a lot to me; the number of visitors not so much. However, I do want search engine tourists to enjoy their stay and find what they're looking for.</p>

<p>I noticed a large amount of Google tourists recently and discovered that a lot of people are <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=west+wing+cancelled&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N">searching for &quot;west wing cancelled&quot;</a>. You guessed it - that was the exact title of <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2006/01/west_wing_cance.html">my recent post</a> on the subject.</p>

<p>Here's where the power of a blog amazes me, though. If you <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=west+wing+cancelled&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N">search Google</a> for &quot;west wing cancelled&quot; right now, this rather small blog is <strong>the number one result</strong>, above MSNBC, Answers.com, CNN, and Ain't It Cool News. Sometimes, it's good to be reminded just how much the world of journalism and media has changed.</p>

<p><em>Quick side note:</em> It turns out the <em>cancelled</em> can legitimately be spelled with 1 or 2 <em>l's</em>,
so those who search for &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=tqV&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=west+wing+canceled&amp;btnG=Search">west wing canceled</a>&quot; will never see my post!</p>
