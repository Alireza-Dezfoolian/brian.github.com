<p>It's always good to note those days when everything seems to fall into place. Ben is really starting to enjoy school a lot more and has had a number of good days in a row. He is in the last phase of LEAP testing (the local enrichment program), just began his creative writing competition, and is doing so well with his piano and baseball activities. His 8th birthday is just a couple of days away and we are all very excited!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the weather has been phenomenal of late, even turning chilly in the last day. Ben and I are going to a Ranger's game tonight. Work has taken a few positive steps forward. Unbelievably, I just had my 3rd anniversary at FC. It has been an amazing 3 years.</p>

<p>I'm very thankful for these many blessings!</p>
