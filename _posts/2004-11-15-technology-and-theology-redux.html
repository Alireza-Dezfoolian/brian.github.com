<p><a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2004/06/5_things_ive_le.html">Robert Scoble's visit to Fellowship</a> has been revisited, this time on <a href="http://mondaymorninginsight.typepad.com/monday_morning_insight_we/2004/11/10_evangelism_a.html">Monday Morning Insight</a>. Each time <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/06/07.html#a7715">Scoble's article</a> is discussed, it provokes a great deal of heated debate and this time is no exception. The comments in this case are well worth reading, including ones by <a href="http://scoble.weblogs.com">Scoble</a> and <a href="http://www.terrystorch.com">Terry Storch</a>. What is a bit different about this case is that it's an argument between the already convinced. I think most outsiders would be surprised to discover how much fun churches have criticizing other churches.</p>

<p>I've found over my brief four years in ministry that every church and church leader must battle against one thing constantly - <strong>arrogance</strong>! Most churches are clear on two things: the inerrant truth of scripture and, a close second, the inerrant method of presenting it. No matter where a church falls (large/small, city/suburban, cutting edge/traditional) you'll find those who feel they have little, if anything, to learn from another church. And at the same time, will effortlessly offer unsolicited criticism of fellow servants and their work. <br /> </p>

<p>As I told Scoble in a brief exchange, he has proven to be more gracious and open-minded than many of us on our best days.</p>
