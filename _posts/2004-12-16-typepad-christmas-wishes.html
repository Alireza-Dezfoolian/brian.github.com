<p>I recently shared <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2004/11/building_a_bett.html">my list</a> of needed TypePad improvements. Now, <a href="http://seems2shel.typepad.com/itseemstome/">Shel Israel</a> , who is beginning a <a href="http://redcouch.typepad.com/">book project with Scoble</a>, has offered his <a href="http://seems2shel.typepad.com/itseemstome/2004/12/typepad_4_areas.html">Four Areas to Improve</a>, which turns out to have many similarities. I hope <a href="http://www.sixapart.com">Six Apart</a> is listening and we'll see some of these changes in the new year. Based on my experience over the past nine months, I think we will.</p>
