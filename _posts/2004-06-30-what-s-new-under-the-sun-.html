<p>John Gruber on the always interesting site <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> has posted a terrific, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/06/dashboard_vs_konfabulator">well-written response</a> to critics who claim that Apple has unfairly stomped on the <a href="http://konfabulator.com/">Konfabulator</a> product with the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/dashboard.html">Dashboard</a> software.</p>

<p>John's essays are thorough and a pleasure to read. In this case, I find myself thoroughly agreeing with him. Apple saw an idea that had been implemented in various ways throughout the last 20 years, <i>most recently</i> by Konfabulator, and came up with a new, original, and better implementation of it.</p>

<p>For more of Apple's perspective on this, <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_06.html#005887">read the perspective</a> of one of the Safari developers. </p>
