<p>The weather turned surprisingly cold and dreary today. Ben's sleepover was extended until nearly 2:00 in order to include yet another Easter Egg hunt and lunch. He had a great time.</p>

<p>We went to the excellent Easter service in the afternoon and then volunteered afterward. Ben and I watched a great Ranger victory into the evening. We are all looking forward to a quiet day together tomorrow.</p>
