<p><a href="http://mikegoldsworthy.com/wordpress/?p=167">Mike Goldsworthy posted</a> his thoughts on the book yesterday:</p><blockquote><p>This was a quick, easy book to read on blogging, that
gave some basics and helped me to think through how to better use
blogging. I’d highly recommend this to every pastor; and since I’ve
read it, I’ve been encouraging several pastors I know to begin blogging
and to get the book to figure out why and how. It’s an important tool
for the church to use. This is a book I’ll reread when I’ve got some
spare time, in order to really figure out how to be more effective with
this. This book will be helpful if you’ve never blogged before, or if
you’re a seasoned veteran.</p></blockquote><p>Mike was kind enough to also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">post a review on Amazon</a>, #10 in fact. If you had told me two months ago that there would be 10 5-star reviews on Amazon, I would never have believed it. God has truly blessed this whole process. Thanks to everyone for taking the time to post reviews and for your generous words! </p>

<p>I'm going to step back now and see where the book is going to go from here. I'll update <a href="http://brianbailey.backpackit.com/pub/784928">the reviews page</a> periodically and link to any big news, but spare you the daily box score and reports from the floor of the stock exchange. It's been a great launch, but I think we're all ready to talk about something else!<br /> </p>
