<p> There is a great conversation taking place on <a href="http://www.terrystorch.com/2005/02/the_fellowship_.html">TerryStorch.com</a>. <a href="http://www.terrystorch.com/2005/02/the_fellowship_.html">Terry wrote</a> about Malcolm Gladwell's <em>The Tipping Point</em>
and how it relates to Fellowship Church, and churches in general. This
provoked some critical comments and some interesting responses which
are worth reading.</p>

<p>Or are they? </p>

<p>In all honesty, I don't know if they are. I would love to read a
serious, honest, heartfelt conversation between those who believe and
those who do not. Struggles, hurts, questions, frustrations, and
disappointments matched with love, hope, and grace. That is a truly
worthwhile conversation.<br /> </p>

<p>This is most assuredly <em>not</em> that conversation. This is simply the criticisms of <em>believers </em>by <em>believers</em>.
Obviously there is a healthy place for debate, but the people who
provoked this intense conversation are not friendly, curious,
questioning or open-minded. They have come for one purpose, to judge
and criticize what by nearly every measure has been an incredible move
of God. The fact that fellow Christians would so freely attack other
churches without humility is an unfortunate example to the many readers
who are outside of the faith.</p>

<p>As I <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2004/11/technology_vs_t.html">wrote a few months ago</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I
think most outsiders would be surprised to discover how much fun
churches have criticizing other churches. I've found over my brief four years in ministry that every church must battle
against one thing constantly - arrogance.
Most churches are clear on two things: the inerrant truth of scripture
and, a close second, the inerrant method of presenting it.</p></blockquote><p>There is only one Way, one Truth, and one Life. There are many ways to do church.</p>
