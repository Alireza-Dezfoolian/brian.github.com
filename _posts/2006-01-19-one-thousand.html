<p>This week, the <a href="http://cp.blogs.com/">Ed Young Podcast</a> from <a href="http://www.creativepastors.com">CreativePastors</a> passed <strong>1,000 subscribers!</strong> When we first launched it in October, we never thought we'd reach that in just four months. It's amazing to see how fast podcasting has gone mainstream. Blogs, podcasts, and DVR's have truly changed what we expect from our content - we want to decide when and where we experience it.</p>

<p>The weekly show is consistently on the iTunes Top 10 most popular listfor the Religion &amp; Spirituality category. If you haven't subscribed yet, you can grab the feed through <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=82034322">iTunes</a> or your favorite <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/cpblog">newsreader</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening!</p>
