<p>A good friend of mine has been a photographer for many years, but he recently struck out on his own and is now doing photography full-time. If you are looking for a photographer in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area, <a href="http://eloyramirez.com/index.html">Eloy Ramirez</a> is a great choice, whether for family portraits, weddings, or commercial shoots. I can testify to what an awesome guy he is - if you want to evaluate his skills, <a href="http://eloyramirez.com/index.html">check out his site</a>.</p>
