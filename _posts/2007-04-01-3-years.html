<p>Today is the 3-year anniversary of Leave It Behind.&nbsp; I've loved the chance to meet so many interesting people, think out loud, become a better writer, and have some great conversations. Thanks to all of you for reading, commenting, and tolerating the wide variety of seemingly unrelated topics!</p>

<p>Since today is April Fool's Day, feel free to enjoy my favorite post of the last year if you missed it the first time: <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2006/10/apple_buys_u2_f.html">Apple Buys U2 for $1.2B</a>.</p>

<p>Congratulations also to Dave Winer and <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Scripting News</a>, celebrating 10 years of blogging. As I've mentioned before, Scripting News was the first blog I ever read and my inspiration to start blogging. I've now been reading Dave for seven years and it was one of my great pleasures in writing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">the book</a> to include a contribution from him. </p>

<p>Dave loves to quote a great line from the Grateful Dead, &quot;It's even worse that it appears.&quot; For his 10th anniversary, I hope he'll consider another option, at least for a day: &quot;Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile!&quot;</p>
