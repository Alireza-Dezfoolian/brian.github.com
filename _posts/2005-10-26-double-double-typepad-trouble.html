<p>I have used <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">TypePad</a> for nearly two years and have loved its power and ease of use. In fact, all of the personal and professional blogs I am involved with are TypePad sites. When people ask me to recommend a blogging tool, my first answer is always TypePad, unless they just want to experiment for free. I love <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">Six Apart</a> and have been consistently amazed by their customer service.</p>

<p>The last two months, however, have severely tested this loyalty. The service has grown increasingly slow, sometimes to the point of being unusable. I have had situations where I had to spend over five minutes just to publish one post. Using any of the administrative tools (includes stats) involves numerous delays. This slow down has been accompanied by actual downtime where the service and our sites are completely unavailable.</p>

<p>No one expects perfection, but TypePad is presented as a premium blog service and charges more than most competitors. With the problems being widespread, and apparently <a href="http://www.terrystorch.com/2005/10/typepad_is_gett.html#comments">including data loss</a>, I would expect an upfront attempt to address this, including what the problem is, what's being done to fix it, when will it be solved, and an apology for the problems. Extending current subscriptions or offering a credit would also be a positive step.</p>

<p>Obviously, rapid growth and great success often lead to growing pains, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm paying for a service that's not reliable. For the first time, I'm investigating alternatives. Hopefully, we'll see some improvements soon.</p>
