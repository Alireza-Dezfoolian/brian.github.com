<p>Today marks the one year anniversary of Leave It Behind! The site launched on April 1, 2004 with <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2004/04/begin_again.html">this post</a> and since that day I have written 431 more. There are few things I've enjoyed more and I thank each and every one of you for choosing to spend some of your limited time reading and commenting on this site. I have learned more than I thought possible and had many terrific experiences and conversations because of you.</p>
