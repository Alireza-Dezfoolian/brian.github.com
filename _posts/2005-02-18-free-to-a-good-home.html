<p>We were recently brainstorming newsletter titles for a recent marketing piece. The email to pastors and church leaders was promoting the message series <a href="http://www.creativepastors.com/store/viewItem.phtml?productId=1119">In the Zone</a>, which focused on giving and blessings. The perfect title came to me: <br /><strong><br />Get on the <em>U.S.S. Stewardship</em>!</strong></p>

<p>Now, is that preaching or what? Can you believe it was rejected?</p>

<p>I offer it here to any and all churches looking for inspiration!</p>
