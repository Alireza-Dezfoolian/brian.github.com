<p>Last night turned out to be a special night for baseball as both Major League Baseball and Bennett League Baseball came to end. Early in the evening, Ben had the last game of his season. He not only got to pitch the last inning, but made the final out with a nice fielding play and throw to first base.</p>

<p>As soon as we got home, we settled in for what seemed absolutely impossible: a <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/ps/y2004/index.jsp">Game 4 Red Sox victory</a>, completing their sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals. I told Ben how fortunate he is to see as a nine-year old what millions of people have waited decades to see: the Boston Red Sox as World Series Champions!  </p>

<p>Baseball has played such a big part of our life over the last eight months, I think we were both a little sad to see it come to end so suddenly. We comforted ourselves by stepping outside and watching some of the phenomenal lunar eclipse.</p>

<p>And, of course, baseball never really ends! Next week will bring all of the season awards. They will be followed by weeks of trade talks and new players. And soon after the first of the year come those  glorious words, <i>pitchers and catchers report</i>!</p>
