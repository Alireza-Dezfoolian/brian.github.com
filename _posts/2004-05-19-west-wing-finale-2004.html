title: West Wing Finale 2004

<p>Tonight was the season finale of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/The_West_Wing/index.html">The West Wing</a>. I thought it was fairly good, but not quite worthy of a season finale. We were watching it on TiVO and even with nearly constant rewinding, we still found ourselves fairly lost. There was a fair amount of tension between the president and Leo, which was well done, but much of the rest was fairly slow moving.</p>

<p>In the process of doing some <em>West Wing</em> research, I came across a great site that summarizes each episode, <a href="http://www.westwingepguide.com/">The West Wing Episode Guide</a>. One of the best parts is the site gathers quotes about each episode from numerous sources, which is where I learned that <em>West Wing's</em> first season finale, What Kind of Day Has It Been, shared its title with the first <em>Sports Night</em> season finale.</p>

<p>Another good site is the <a href="http://westwing.bewarne.com">West Wing Continuity Guide</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note to Google tourists:</strong> I apologize that your search for information about the series finale of West Wing has led you to this 2-year old post about the 2004 finale. I finally renamed this post so the next person who finds it will have a better idea of what they're getting. For the record, I am still a huge WW fan and eagerly anticipate (and dread) the series finale. Unfortunately, I have no helpful information about it :(</p>
