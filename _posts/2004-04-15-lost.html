<p>The day was quickly lost to a series of meetings and interviews, some more worthwhile than others. The evening was spent with <em><a href="http://www.lost-in-translation.com/">Lost in Translation</a></em>, a truly hypnotic film that continues to play out in your mind long after it is over. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are both wonderful.</p>

<p>And as a bonus, the web site is very well done and gorgeous to look at.</p>
