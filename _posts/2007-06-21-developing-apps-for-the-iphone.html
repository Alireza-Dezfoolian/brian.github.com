<p>Three great pieces on developing applications for the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">Apple iPhone</a>:</p>

<p>Here is Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/06/11iphone.html">original announcement</a> on building apps for the iPhone through the Safari browser and current Web 2.0 technologies. And one more thing: you will soon have a <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/internet/?feature=feature05">special YouTube player</a> for watching videos on the iPhone. </p>

<p>I definitely see an iPhone in my future, but I will wait for the next version, sure to feature many fixes, improvements (camera, capacity, and battery life?) , and a faster network.</p>
