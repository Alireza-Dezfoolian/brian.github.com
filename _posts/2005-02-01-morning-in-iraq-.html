<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/01/opinion/01brooks.html?oref=login&amp;hp">David Brooks offers</a> a great perspective on this weekend''s Iraqi election:</p><blockquote><p>In fact, these are a people who voted at higher rates in the face of
death than we do in the face of inconvenience. These are a people who
have used the campaign as a process of therapy and self-education.
These people have just built the most democratic government in the Arab
world.</p></blockquote>
