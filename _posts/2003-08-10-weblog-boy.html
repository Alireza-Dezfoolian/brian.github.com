<p>What a terrific Sunday. I was able to spend the entire day with my wonderful son Ben. As per his request, it featured a highly competitive game of MLB Showdown, a baseball card game that can satisfy the most addicted baseball fanatic.</p>

<p>In the evening, we had an amazing time as I set him up with his very own weblog! We had been talking about every since the last day of school, but I couldn't stand the thought of introducing him to weblogs using any tool other than Typepad. My suspicions were confirmed tonight as he was immediately captivated by the power and simplicity of this amazing tool. He was thrilled to no end and by the end of the night was more interested in his new site than watching baseball.</p>
