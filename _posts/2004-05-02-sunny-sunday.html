<p>We woke up to one of the most beautiful days of the year, after two days of rain. The sky was crystal clear and temperature in the low 70's. Unfortunately, the baseball fields were still too wet to use, so Ben had two baseball games postponed this weekend. </p>

<p>Ben and I went for a bike ride, played with our <a href="http://www.beamo.com/">Beamo</a>, created some excellent music with <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/">Garageband</a>, and watched the Rangers finish a sweep of the Red Sox. Unbelievably, the Rangers now have the best record in baseball after the first month of the season.</p>

<p>Lori, Ben and I also had a great dinner conversation about what is our favorite thing to think about while we go to sleep. Mine turned out to be much the same as Ben's...new ideas of things to do or create. For me, I particularly love to think about names of the things, such as this website, or a book or movie idea.</p>
