<p>Early tomorrow, the Baileys filled the Element with our sand n' surf collection and left for Destin, Florida! Each summer we try to take at least one lengthy family vacation and this year we chose the beaches of north Florida. Up to this point, Ben's best beach experience was in Galveston on the Texas coast, which he loved but lacked some of the essentials, like soft sand and clear blue water.</p>

<p>Destin is a 12-hour drive away, which seems like a simple day trip after our Rocky Mountains vacation last summer. This is our first family trip in the Element and we can't wait to enjoy the extra room, comfortable seats, and super convenient auxiliary jack, which will be perfect for our iPod filled with audio books.</p>

<p>Updates may be sporadic and of limited interest, so your patience is appreciated!
