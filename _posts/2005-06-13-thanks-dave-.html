<p>You'll find a new addition to my site today - this simple, little badge:</p>

<p><img border="0" alt="Thanks Dave 4" title="Thanks Dave 4" src="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/thanksdave4.jpg" />
</p>

<p>The badge is a link to <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Scripting News</a>, the weblog home of Dave Winer. If you hover over the image on the site, you should see the following text:</p>

<p><em>My thanks to Dave Winer for his visionary role in the development of weblogs, RSS, podcasting, SOAP, XML-RPC, OPML, and outliners.</em></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>As a loyal reader of Dave's site over the past five years, I've grown to share his frustration with the way his contributions to the Internet are recorded and viewed. Time after time, he has played a substantial role in the development and evangelizing of new technology (particularly weblogs, RSS, and podcasting), only to have his effort and contribution ignored or substantially diminished over time. </p>

<p>I decided it was time for those of us who owe so much to Dave to do something about it. I can't change what other reporters and bloggers write, but I can place a simple image on my site that reminds me, and everyone who visits my site, of the role he has played in making all of this possible.&nbsp; Simply put, without Dave, I certainly wouldn't be blogging and much of the blog revolution that has swept across the country and the world would not exist.</p>

<p>So, grab one of these badges or make your own, link it to <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Scripting News</a>, and join with me in saying...</p>

<p><span style="color: #3333ff;"><strong><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">Thanks Dave!</span></strong></span></p>

<p>If you add one of these to your site, send me an email or comment on this post and I'll post a follow-up in the near future. <em>Ask not what the Internet can do for you, ask what you can do for the Internet</em>.<br />
