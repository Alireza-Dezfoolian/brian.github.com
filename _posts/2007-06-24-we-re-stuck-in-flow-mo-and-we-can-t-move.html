<p>You know your sleepy suburban town has arrived when you have your <a href="http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=2033435682">own rap video: Flow Mo</a>. We've lived in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Flower+Mound,+TX&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=33.033996,-97.059402&amp;spn=0.302214,0.628281&amp;z=11&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1">Flower Mound, Texas</a> for nearly twelve years and watched in grow from 30,000 people to a thriving metropolis of 60,000. Located just north of DFW Airport, halfway between Dallas and Ft. Worth, Flower Mound is an awesome place to live and raise a family. The schools are excellent, the Starbucks are plentiful, and everyone is very friendly.</p>

<p>Of course, it probably looks very different if you're a teenager. &quot;We've got nothing to do. We're stuck in Flow Mo and we can't move.&quot; I think it's a rite of passage to be bored with your hometown when you're in high school - I know I was. <a href="http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=2033435682">Check out</a> this hilarious and incredibly well done video - these are some talented (admittedly white) guys and girls. As a bonus, you get a fun tour of Flow Mo :)</p>
