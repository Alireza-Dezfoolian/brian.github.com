<p>Six Apart released a redesigned website this week which is terrific. Have a look at it <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">here</a>, then read the <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/about/news/2005/02/welcome_to_the.html">PR version</a> and <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/about/corner/2005/02/new_site_launch.html">Mena's version</a>. They faced a significant challenge in uniting a diverse set of brands under a single banner and in my opinion pulled it off quite well.</p>

<p>Soon after the launch, I started seeing referrals from <a href="http://www.sixapart.com">www.SixApart.com</a> in my TypePad blog statistics. Curious, I followed the link trail to the source - I am currently featured on the Six Apart site!</p>

<p>If you visit the terribly important <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/typepad/compare">TypePad Compare Features page</a>, you'll find a product endorsement from yours truly.</p><blockquote><p>“If you are still searching for a great weblog tool, it is time to try TypePad.” </p></blockquote><p>Be sure to visit soon before I'm replaced by someone more eloquent than me (and by all means, pick up a <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/typepad/pricing">TypePad trial</a> while you're there if you're still on the fence). As this is my first participation in an ad campaign (I don't even have an agent) I'll have to make sure I don't violate any IRS or trade union regulations.</p>

<p>Of course, I am not a paid endorsee, but I am a more-than-happy-to-do-it one. <a href="http://www.typepad.com">TypePad</a> is the best there is (though they share the title with <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a> and <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a>). All are testaments to what happens when good people make good software. </p>
