title: Ron Silver Inspires Democrats Following Election Loss
published: 1

<p>As many people know, actor Ron Silver prominently supported George Bush during the election, giving his <a href="http://www.gopconvention.com/cgi-data/speeches/files/59dt935610x09w99ck6cl1a23s174pii.shtml">first major political speech</a> at the Republican Convention in August. The speech was one of the highlights of the week and he has proven to be an effective, passionate spokesman for the president.</p>

<p>I found it terribly funny, then, to come across this episode of <em>The West Wing</em> just days after the election. Silver spent a large part of one season as a somewhat ruthless campaign advisor for President Bartlett. Here's Silver's (well, Bruno Gianelli's actually) speech when Sam and Toby are reluctant to run issue ads because they don't conform to the spirit of the law:</p>

<p><em>I am tired of working for candidates who make me think I should be embarrassed to believe what I believe.

I'm tired of getting them elected.

</em></p>

<p><em>We all need some therapy.

Because somebody came along and said liberal means &quot;soft on crime&quot;, &quot;soft on drugs&quot;, &quot;soft on communism&quot;, &quot;soft on defense&quot; and we're going to tax you back to the Stone Age because people shouldn't have to go to work if they don't want to? And instead of saying, &quot;Well, excuse me, you right-wing, reactionary, xenophobic, homophobic, anti-education, anti-choice, pro-gun, Leave it to Beaver-trip back to the 50's&quot; we cowered in the corner and said, &quot;Please don't hurt me.&quot;

</em></p>

<p><em>No more.

</em></p>

<p><em>I really don't care who's right, who's wrong. We're both right. We're both wrong.

Let's have two parties. Huh? What do say?<br /></em></p>

<p>It appears that Mr. Gianelli is a Howard Dean Democrat :)<em><br /></em></p>
