<p>Broken heart don't feel so bad<br />
Ain't got half a what you thought you had<br />
Rock your baby to and fro<br />
Not too fast and not too slow</p>

<p>And I say row, Jimmy, row<br />
Gonna get there?<br />
I don't know<br />
Seems a common way to go<br />
Get down and row, row, row</p>

<p>> Grateful Dead > Row Jimmy </p>
