<p>I'm slowly learning that keeping Google happy is a full-time job. From PageRank to search result placement and AdWords to AdSense, you must constantly monitor and develop your website's relationship with Google.</p>

<p>Today's class was on <a href="http://www.google.com/technology/">PageRank</a>. First, I discovered that there still isn't an ideal toolbar solution for non-Microsoft browsers if you want easy access to a site's PageRank. If you are using Internet Explore, just download the <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/googlebar.html">Google Toolbar</a> and you're all set.</p>

<p>I did find an excellent alternative, however. <a href="http://www.tapouillo.com/firefox_extension/">This Firefox extension</a> adds a PageRank display to your status bar. I've installed it and so far it works great.</p>

<p>Second, I found a number of sites that allow you to submit a website address and receive the site's PageRank if you'd like to avoid installing any toolbars or extensions. <a href="http://www.sawpit.net/home/index.php?module=pagemaster&amp;PAGE_user_op=view_page&amp;PAGE_id=27&amp;MMN_position=45:45">Here is the simplest one</a> I found.</p>

<p>Lastly, I discovered that this site is doing fairly well (a PageRank of 5), as are the sites I managed. For large church sites, 5 appears to be a typical ranking. <a href="http://www.redfusionmedia.com/google_pagerank.htm">Here's a basic article</a> on what your PageRank means. What is particularly interesting about this is that my personal site has achieved such a high ranking despite being only a year old and receiving far less traffic than our sites. </p>



<p>This is not something to brag about (in fact, it could interpreted as a sign that I have invested more effort in the success of my own site, which would be a <em><strong>very bad thing!</strong></em>), but an indication of how highly Google values blogs and particularly the conversations (i.e. <em>links</em>) that they inevitably produce. </p>

<p>Over the next month, we will begin rolling out new features to help address this, as sites that participate in and encourage those conversations <strong>will eventually surpass those that rely on traffic alone</strong>. <br /> </p>
