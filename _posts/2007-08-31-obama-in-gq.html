<p>There's a very interesting cover story on <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/index.php">Barack Obama</a> in this month's GQ Magazine. The article provides a lengthy behind-the-scenes look at the campaign, the candidate, his family, and what it will take to catch Hilary Clinton. The <a href="http://men.style.com/gq/features/landing?id=content_5841">full piece is available online</a>, though they will make you earn it by spreading the text over 14 different pages. Definitely worth the investment, though.</p>
