<p>» My son Ben is hilarious. We were talking about the iPhone today and he said he's sure Microsoft will come out with a competitor — they'll call it the <strong>microPhone</strong>!</p>
<p>» <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876?tag2=leaveitbehind-20">The Blogging Church</a> review crisis on Amazon appears to be resolved. All 26 reviews are now back online. Apparently the return of the reviews has led to a run on the book as Amazon is showing only 3 in stock. You've been warned :)</p>

<p>» Many of you continue to post very kind comments about the book. I really appreciate the feedback! <a href="http://brenttrf.blogspot.com/2007/07/reading-rainbow-week-2book2.html">Brent Hodges gave the book</a> one of the nicest compliments I've read: </p>

<blockquote><p>I was actually pleasantly surprised with this book. I knew going into this book that I was in for a lot of great information and disciplines in creating and maintaining a blog. <strong>I did not expect how creatively it was written.</strong> I think we have certain expectations for &quot;how-to&quot; books and this one surpassed my expectations. [emphasis added]</p></blockquote>

<p>He also appreciated the &quot;the hopeful message from start to finish,&quot; which was honestly one of my goals. <em>Thanks, Brent!</em> </p>

<p>» <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type 4</a> gets more interesting all the time. As a blogging and community platform, this looks like it's going to be outstanding. In addition to enterprise versions, the software is now available as a free, open source project. </p>
<p>» In the sporting world, the <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=221116&amp;cc=5901">USA shocked Brazil 2-1</a> in the Under-20 World Cup. It was a terrific match to watch. And tomorrow morning, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon07/columns/story?columnist=garber_greg&amp;id=2928769">Roger Federer faces Rafael Nadal</a> in the men's final at Wimbledon. Should be a classic.</p>
