<p>After many hours of research, I at last ordered a new laptop bag for the Powerbook and it arrived in only two days, a wonderful surprise! I decided on the Cozmo bag from <a href="http://www.sfbags.com">WaterField Designs</a> and it is everything I had hoped. Every single WaterField review I came across on the web emphasized two things: the first-rate quality and the first-rate customer service. My experience has lived up to that exactly.</p>

<p>I was searching for a bag that was small, light, professional and cool. I also insisted that it protect a 12" Powerbook very well while still allowing for accessories, small books, magazines, and a notebook. For this, the Cozmo bag is perfect. <i>Highly recommended!</i></p>
