<p>Believe it or not, my post on the <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2007/03/top_10_songs_ab.html">Top 10 Songs About Kids</a> was originally going to include just five. Now, I actually have a few left over. Here are some honorable mentions:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/j/john+lennon/beautiful+boy_20161974.html">Beautiful Boy</a> by John Lennon<br /><a href="http://www.tsrocks.com/e/everything_but_the_girl_texts/apron_strings.html">
Apron Strings</a> by Everything But the Girl<br /><a href="http://www.tsrocks.com/j/jerry_garcia_texts/teddy_bears_picnic.html">
Teddy Bears' Picnic</a> performed by Jerry Garcia and David Grisman</p>

<p>Here are a few interesting reads for the weekend.</p>

<p><a href="http://loribailey.wordpress.com/2007/03/01/pencil-pusher/">Pencil Pusher</a> - hilarious post by my lovely wife about elementary school addictions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2160944">Reagan's Favorite Sitcom</a> - great article on <a href="http://www.slate.com">Slate</a> about <em>Family Ties</em> and it's odd role in political history. I found out about it because the author, David Haglund, links to <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2006/05/god_put_a_smile.html">my post about the show</a> in the piece.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/sports/playmagazine/04play-howard.html?ex=1330578000&amp;en=650340d374351bfc&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink">Ryan Howard, No Asterisk</a> - lengthy NYT piece on baseball's newest slugger to get you in the mood for spring training.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/01/garden/01bed.html?ex=1330578000&amp;en=4d5068519f600b61&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink">Whose Bed is it Anyway?</a> - another from the Times, this one on the increase in older children sleeping in the parent's bed. It's always a risk when the marriage becomes secondary to the children, something all of us struggle with.</p>
