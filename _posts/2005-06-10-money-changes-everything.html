<p>One of things I love about this blog is that it allows me to experiment with various web technologies. Today, the technology of choice is <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/">Google AdSense</a>.</p>

<p>You can't follow blogs without constantly reading about (and viewing) Google ads. When Google recently announced the beta release of <a href="https://www.google.com/support/adsense/bin/answer.py?answer=20012">AdSense for Feeds</a> and <a href="http://www.burningdoor.com/feedburner/archives/001193.html">FeedBurner made it easy</a> to implement, I thought I'd give it a try. It's always fun to see how a piece of technology works.</p>

<p>I also added AdSense to the site itself, and what's my first ad? A dating service! Perfect.</p>

<p>Please understand that this is nothing more than an experiment. There is a raging debate about adding ads to RSS feeds, and I am inclined to agree with those who hope to keep feeds pure. I personally will unsubscribe from a partial-text feed before one with ads, but the best thing is that we all get to make that decision one site at a time.</p>

<p>No need to unsubscribe here, though. I'll post an update on how this goes and most likely remove them after a couple of weeks. I'm particularly interested to see if and how the ads are optimized over time. I'm sure there will be some ads that I wouldn't personally choose; I apologize for those in advance!</p>
