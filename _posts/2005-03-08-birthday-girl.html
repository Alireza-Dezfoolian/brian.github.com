<p><strong>Happy Birthday</strong> to the love of my life, my wonderful wife <a href="http://bailey.typepad.com">Lori</a>! I have had the immense privilege of being part of every birthday since our junior year of high school, and she only gets more amazing every year. </p>

<p>In the immortal words of <a href="http://www.benfoldsfive.com/lyrics/whatever_06.html">Ben Folds Five</a>:</p><blockquote><p>She's everything I want<br />She's everything I'm not</p></blockquote><p>We had a great time celebrating, both at work with the many terrific people there (at the home of the <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/03/gleaming_the_qu.html">fun, married couple</a> who, sadly, remain blog-less), and at home, with Ben's sweet enthusiasm and homemade card.</p>
