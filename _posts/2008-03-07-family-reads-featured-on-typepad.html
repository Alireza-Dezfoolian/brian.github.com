<p><a href="http://www.familyreads.com">Family Reads</a> is today's <a href="http://featured.typepad.com/blogs/2008/03/family-reads.html">featured blog on TypePad</a>! Check out some of the very kind words they shared about our new little site:</p>

<blockquote>This is a wonderful online bookstore and library all rolled into one, and will be a big help in encouraging your kids to read.</blockquote>

<p>We really appreciate being highlighted by <a href="http://www.typepad.com">TypePad</a>. When we decided to do Family Reads, we spent a long time looking at all the different options for hosting and developing the site. In the end, TypePad was the perfect choice for us; it's hard to beat the combination of power and simplicity.</p>

<p>Today is also a big day for Family Reads because we just posted our <strong>50th review</strong>!</p>
