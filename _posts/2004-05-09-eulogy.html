<p>Just over two years ago, my father passed away. I have been thinking about him a lot of late, and even though it is Mother's Day (and I'm very blessed to have my mother still with us), even more so today. I drove to Illinois two years ago with the uncomfortable feeling that I may be asked to speak at his funeral. I hoped and prayed that this would not be the case, but I had an underlying sense that it was something I had to do, and would do. </p>

<p>The words came to me throughout the 14 hour drive, line after line, without effort. Each time a clever phrase would come to mind, I would laughingly shake my fist at God and say, "Now I really <i>am</i> going to have to do this!" </p>

<p>So, here it is in its entirety. As I told everyone that cool, rainy weekend, it's the best thing I've ever written...and I didn't write a single word of it.</p>
