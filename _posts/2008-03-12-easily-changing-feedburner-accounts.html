title: Easily changing FeedBurner accounts

<p>I've been using <a href="">FeedBurner</a> for years and still love it. Basically, you provide your blog's RSS feed and it does some nice formatting for different newsreaders and a simple address you can share with the world. The best part is you can change your blog host without impacting your RSS subscribers, since the feed address your readers use does not change. Plus it's free and provides some nice (though not entirely reliable) stats.</p>

<p>Now, FeedBurner has made it dead simple to <a href="http://blogs.feedburner.com/feedburner/archives/2008/03/from_the_dept_of_quick_hits_tr_1.php">move a feed from one FeedBurner account to another</a>. Say you worked for a company and helped setup a blog or two using FeedBurner. You can easily move those feeds to someone else's FeedBurner account if you happen to leave.</p>

<p>Or maybe you experimented using your personal account and now want to switch to a shared corporate account instead. <a href="http://blogs.feedburner.com/feedburner/archives/2008/03/from_the_dept_of_quick_hits_tr_1.php">Here's how to do it</a>.</p>
