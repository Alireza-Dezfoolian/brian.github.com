<p>According to the fantastic <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">FeedBurner</a> service, the <a href="http://blog.fellowshipchurch.com">Fellowship Church Blog</a> passed 200 subscribers yesterday for the first time! Just like stocks, web stats seem to hit resistance at certain levels and the FC Blog had come close to 200 a few times, but suddenly reached 220 this week. </p>

<p>Since we're reaching much more of a mainstream technology audience with that site, we're thrilled to discover a growing adoption of blog tools. We'll soon have blogs for each of our campuses that should greatly increase the role of blogs in the Fellowship Church experience.
