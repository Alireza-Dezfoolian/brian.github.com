<p>Tonight at Fellowship Church we began a new fall series, Who's Kidding Who? on the challenges and misconceptions of parenting. This weekend was phenomenal, both provocative and humorous. Ed's messages will be <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com/fcweb/servicetimes/currentseries.aspx?pgId=159">online throughout</a> the series, so enjoy!</p>
