<p>This year's <a href="http://www.creativepastors.com/c32007.php">Creative Church Conference</a> starts tomorrow afternoon at Fellowship Church. It's going to be a fantastic three days packed with <a href="http://www.creativepastors.com/c32007-speakers.php">five incredible leaders</a>, outstanding worship, and hands-on breakout sessions. This is my seventh C3 and each one has been more challenging and inspiring than the one before. I know one thing: this year is going to be unlike any other C3.</p>

<p>I'll be blogging the conference on the <a href="http://cp.blogs.com">CreativePastors blog</a>. Look for updates there starting tomorrow or just <a href="http://www.creativepastors.com/">visit the site</a> for the latest.</p>
