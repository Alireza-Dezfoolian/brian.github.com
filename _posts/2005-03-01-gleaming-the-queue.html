<p>A cool, married couple we know passed on a bit of information that was announced in January: Netflix now offers the holy grail of queue management! Yes, at last, you can create different queues for each member of the household and automatically rotate which movies are shipped. Read <a href="http://www.hackingnetflix.com/netflix/2005/01/netflix_launche.html">Hacking Netflix</a> for a complete report.</p>

<p>Here's my <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2004/08/carts_and_queue.html">plea from last August</a>:</p><blockquote><p>My dream feature would be the ability to <strong>categorize movies and then have them shipped according to a sort of category rotation</strong>.
One family might setup a category for each person and then have it
rotate between family members (one for dad, one for mom, one for the
kids, then one for dad, etc...). Another house, however, might setup
categories based on type (one action, one drama, one comedy, one
family, one documentary, etc...). The queue would just send the next
available movie in the rotation.</p></blockquote><p>I hope Netflix knows where to send my residuals :)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am a committed <a href="http://www.blockbuster.com/homepages/LoadBlockbusterHomepage.action">Blockbuster Online</a> customer due to the great price, in-store coupons, and lightening fast turnaround in the DFW area (1-day each way). I do hope that Blockbuster responds to the competition and releases a major update to their queue in the near future - it is easily the weakest part of the site.</p>
