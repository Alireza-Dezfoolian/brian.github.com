<p>You can now pre-order your copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/0787984876&tag=leaveitbehind-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">The Blogging Church</a>!</p>

<p>Early this morning, the book became available for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/0787984876&tag=leaveitbehind-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">pre-order from Amazon.com</a>. Not only that, but it's priced to move! The official price of the paperback was set at $19.99 a month ago and Amazon is offering it at 35% off - just $12.97. That's quite a price-per-word ratio - each dollar buys you nearly 5,000 words :)</p>

<p>I had no idea the book would be available so soon, as the cover art, endorsements, and final edits are still to come. I remember reading when <a href="http://redcouch.typepad.com/weblog/2005/08/were_on_amazon_.html">Naked Conversations first appeared on Amazon</a> back in August. I had probably written about 200 words and I was trying to imagine what that would feel like.</p>

<p>I have to say, it feels really good. Thanks to all of you for your support, enthusiasm, and patience throughout this process. I'll try to keep the commercials to a minimum!</p>
