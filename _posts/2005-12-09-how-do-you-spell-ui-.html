title: How do you spell UI?

<p>With words, of course! User interface is often as much about the words you choose as the actual layout of the page. Just the simple question of what to call a confirmation button can cause a lengthy debate: Save, Register, Complete, Next, Done, Finish?</p>

<p>I was thinking about this because at the same time that <a href="http://www.micropersuasion.com/2005/12/gmail_adds_rss_.html">Google was adding RSS feeds to Gmail</a>, they also made a small change to the Gmail UI. What was once called <strong>Move to trash</strong> is now called <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>

<p>I know I'm a web geek, but this stuff fascinates me. I'm sure it was a very intentional decision to use <strong>Move to trash</strong> in the first place, when most people would be looking for <strong>Delete</strong>. First, they probably wanted to be a little different and innovative. Second, they wanted to subtly train people to think different about mail. In other words, don't think in terms of deleting or &quot;getting rid of&quot; your mail. Just think about it as filing mail you don't want in a folder called Trash. After all, with Gmail, you should never have to permanently delete anything.</p>

<p>It confused me for the first two weeks I used Gmail. Everytime I wanted to get rid of a message, I kept looking for the Delete option. Of course, I then got used to it and came to really like the phrase and how it stood out in the drop down box.</p>

<p>Now, <strong>Move to trash</strong> is gone and we have <strong>Delete</strong> instead. I wonder how much trouble Move to trash has caused them? I wonder how many people have been confused about how to delete a message? I assume they finally had a meeting and decided to go with what most people expect. Sometimes being different causes more trouble than it's worth. Of course, <em>now I'm</em> confused again, but I'm sure I'll get used to it.</p>

<p>I've had a similar idea on <a href="http://www.fellowshipchurch.com">FellowshipChurch.com</a>. It's always a struggle to come up with names that make sense to people, especially for things like prayer, missions, and counseling. That section is currently called &quot;Care &amp; Prayer&quot;, as it is on many church websites, and for the longest time I've wanted to call it &quot;Help&quot;. Whether you want help, or want <em>to</em> help, it's all right there under one, simple word. I just think it's brilliant, until everyone reminds me that when you're on a website and you see the word &quot;Help&quot;, you assume that it's a section designed to help you use the site.</p>

<p>I still think it's a cool idea, though.</p>
