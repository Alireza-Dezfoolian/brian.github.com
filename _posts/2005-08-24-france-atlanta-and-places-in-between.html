<p>Once in awhile, someone posts a comment and it's like hearing from an old friend. That happened to me the other day when <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/home/2005/08/undivided.html">Katherine wrote some kind words</a> about a recent post. For those of you who don't know, Katherine has written <a href="http://30seconds.blogs.com/">a great blog</a> for a long time now, but it became even more fascinating in the last few months as she's documented her family's move from the States to southern France. </p>

<p><a href="http://bailey.typepad.com">My wife</a> and Katherine share so many similarities that the fact that she's now fulfilling Lori's lifelong dream is a little frightening. Our family has been enjoying learning the cultural differences and even simple things like charging for grocery bags at the store. Here's a <a href="http://30seconds.blogs.com/archives/2005/08/i_know_my_passi.html">great sample of her writing</a>, even though it has little to do with France.</p>

<p>Speaking of wonderful female bloggers, don't forget to spend some quality time with <a href="http://amylovesbooks.blogspot.com/">Amy Loves Books</a>. This post from last week is fantastic: <a href="http://amylovesbooks.blogspot.com/2005/08/someplace-i-have-never-been.html">Someplace I Have Never Been</a>.</p>
