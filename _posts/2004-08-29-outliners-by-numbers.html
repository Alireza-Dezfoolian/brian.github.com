<p>Over the past year, I've been greatly enjoying the monthly web publication <a href="http://www.atpm.com/index.shtml">About This Particular Macintosh</a>. The magazine (well, e-zine) is very well done and filled with interesting articles, how-to's, and product reviews. The writing is friendly, personal, and enthusiastic.</p>

<p>The highlight of recent issues has been an ongoing series by Ted Goranson on outlining and mind mapping software, aptly titled <a href="http://www.atpm.com/10.08/atpo.shtml">About This Particular Outliner</a>. Now, I fully admit my personal obsession with this category of software. I have downloaded and experimented with nearly every major title on both the PC and Macintosh, searching for the perfect notetaking, knowledge management, brainstorming tool. What Ted has done is pull together more data, more experimentation, and more screenshots than you could possibly imagine. In September, ATPO is going to publish an in-depth look at <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a>, one of the most unique, challenging, and powerful programs available on the Macintosh.</p>

<p>Even if you have no interest in the software, you'll find yourself wishing there was someone like Ted writing about your favorites piece of technology.</p>
