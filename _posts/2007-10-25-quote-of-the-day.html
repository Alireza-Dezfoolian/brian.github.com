<p>Daniel Henninger in his <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119327146107670665.html?mod=opinion_main_featured_stories_hs">Wall Street Journal column on Rudy Giuliani</a> and social conservatives:</p> 	
<blockquote><p>In the &quot;60s, the left introduced the &quot;non-negotiable
demand&quot; into our politics. It's still with us. It's political
infantilism. In real life, the non-negotiable &quot;demand&quot; usually ends
about age six.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well worth a read.</p>
