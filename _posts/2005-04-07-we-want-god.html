<p><a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110006523">Peggy Noon on Pope John Paul II</a> and the tidal wave he started in Poland in 1979, a tidal wave that eventually toppled communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.</p><blockquote><p>I think I know the moment Soviet communism began its fall. It happened in public. Anyone could see it. It was one of the great spiritual moments of the 20th century, maybe the greatest.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>John Paul gave us what may be the transcendent public spiritual moment of the 20th century. &quot;We want God.&quot; The greatest and most authentic cry of the human heart.</p></blockquote>
