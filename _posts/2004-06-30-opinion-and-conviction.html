<p>Dave Winer has some <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2004/06/30#mooresTactics">very interesting comments</a> on Michael Moore. One thing I have always appreciated about Dave is he is remains fiercely independent whether the subject is politics, software, or anything else. He commits to an issue or opinion and defends it with passion. In this he reminds me somewhat of John McCain. </p>

<p>Of course, I disagree with Dave a fair amount, as in his <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2004/06/27#When:10:48:15AM">recent post</a> regarding Bush's campaign commercial featuring Hitler images from a since-rejected MoveOn.org ad, which we had a cordial email debate about. </p>

<p>When I view the list of Sunday talk show appearances by politicians and assorted talking heads, I try to avoid anyone whose answers are so completely obvious and predictable as to be worthless. I prefer people who look at each question with fresh eyes and attempt to apply their own, core principles to the issue in front of them.</p>
