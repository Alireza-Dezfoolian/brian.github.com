<p>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> posts <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/0,,SB109278109869594104,00.html">questionnaires</a> with the bloggers who will be covering the Republican Convention next week. A great read and an equally great source of sites to explore. [via <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Scripting News</a>]</p>
