<p>I wanted to get all of my readers something special for Christmas and I finally came up with the perfect thing. I know it seems a little extravagant, but you all mean so much to me that I went ahead and got each of you <strong>your very own radio station</strong>. </p>

<p>And all you have to do is click a link...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a></p>

<p>Imagine if you could create your very own radio station. Imagine that it is filled with all of your favorite artists, but also regularly introduces you to new music that you love.</p>

<p>Now imagine that this station <strong>has no commercials and is free</strong>, accessible from any web browser, simple to use, and very high quality. Oh yeah, you can also create as many stations as you want and share them with friends.</p>

<p>Pandora launched recently and has been raved about by people much smarter than me. When I finally gave it a try, though, I was absolutely amazed. If you love music, you will absolutely love <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a>.</p>

<p>You don't even have to create an account to experience how cool it is (major bonus points). You can be experiencing outstanding music in about a minute. Let me apologize in advance for whatever you don't get done today.</p>

<p>Leave a comment or send me an email and I'll send you one of my stations. And if you create some cool stations of your own, send them my way.

<p><em>Merry Christmas!</em></p>
