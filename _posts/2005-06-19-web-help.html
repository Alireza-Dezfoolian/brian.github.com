<p>Here are two excellent posts from <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/">37Signals</a> in case you missed them. Both focus on the most neglected aspect of web development - what to do when things don't work.</p>

<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/37signals/beMH?m=352">Copywriting is interface design</a>. Write good interfaces!</p>

<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/37signals/beMH?m=363">Tips for getting good customer support</a>. Every website should offer this kind of direction.</p>

<p><em>Bonus item</em>: Infoworld ran a great overview of the AJAX phenomenon last month. The article promimently features 37Signals as well: <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/05/23/21FEwebapp_1.html?s=feature">The Browser Reloaded</a>.</p>
