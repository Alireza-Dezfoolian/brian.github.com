<p>Today we released our most recent web project, a site dedicated to Fellowship's upcoming <a href="http://www.fellowshipconnection.com/FCONWeb/conferences/c3_2005.aspx">Creative Church Conference</a>. Developing a conference site each year is one of my favorite projects as it is a manageable undertaking (less than 10 pages) that still allows for substantial creativity. Conference sites also present some unique challenges as they have to capture someone's attention, while reflecting the spirit of event. It is essential that the design be clean, simple, and very easy use.</p>

<p>My team worked very hard over the last two weeks to make it happen. Feel free to browse through the site and offer any feedback. And if your in the church world, by all means, consider coming to Dallas in January...we'd love to see you there!</p>
