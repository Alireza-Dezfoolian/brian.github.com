<p>When <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2005/11/27/my-blogroll-is-up-to-date/">Scoble purged</a> his feeds in November, <a href="http://www.newsome.org/">Kent Newsome</a> started <a href="http://www.newsome.org/2005/11/scoblefeeds-z-couple-of-as.shtml">a fun, ambitious project</a>. He set out to explore all 750 +/- of Scoble's blog subscriptions and review them letter by letter, looking for new stuff. For each letter, he chooses the best new blog. I thought it was a cool project before, but now I think it's brilliant! Why? Well, he finally made it to the <strong>L's</strong> :)</p>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://www.newsome.org/2006/01/scoblefeeds-z-ls.shtml">Kent chose Leave It Behind as his favorite L blog</a>, in a tie with Chris Anderson's outstanding <a href="http://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/">Long Tail site</a>. He called this blog &quot;a really good mix of tech, family stuff and other interesting topics&quot; which, in the end, is about all this site aspires to be. <em>Thanks, Ken!</em></p>
