<p>Hello, my name is Brian and I'm an author, product manager, and content strategist. I currently work with the talented team at <a href="http://returnpath.net">Return Path</a>. Before that, I was the Glue Guy at <a href="http://gowalla.com">Gowalla</a>, from our start above a Starbucks in a Dallas suburb, through our move to Austin and our acquisition by Facebook four years later. If you'd like to connect with me professionally, introduce yourself on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/brianbailey">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
	
<p>A few years ago, I wrote a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876">book on blogging</a> that reached #3 on Amazon's Movers &amp; Shakers list and #148 overall. I know this because I hit refresh often. It included contributions from Kathy Sierra, Guy Kawasaki, Merlin Mann, Dave Winer, Robert Scoble, David Weinberger, Shel Israel, and more. Seth Godin even provided a quote for the cover. I hope to write another one.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite things are chai lattes, Arsenal FC, hiking, Austin, presidential campaigns, listening to live music, writing, and chasing new ideas.</p>
<p>I met my wife, <a href="http://twitter.com/loribailey">Lori</a>, in 8th grade and I've been thanking God for her ever since. It's like Wonder Years if Kevin and Winnie had ended up together. We have a delightful, talented son, <a href="http://benbailey.me">Ben</a>, who is in high school, but still enjoys hanging out and going to Radiohead concerts with me.</p>
<p>I love sharing life with creative and curious people. I hope you&rsquo;re one of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="http://twitter.com/bb">@bb on Twitter</a>. Say hello or <a href="mailto:brianbailey@gmail.com">drop me a note</a>.</p>
