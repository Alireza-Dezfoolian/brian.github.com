<p>Hello, my name is Brian and I work at <a href="http://gowalla.com">Gowalla</a> in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I wrote a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876">book on blogging</a> that briefly reached #3 on Amazon's Movers &amp; Shakers list and #148 overall. I know this because I hit refresh often. It included contributions from Kathy Sierra, Guy Kawasaki, Merlin Mann, Dave Winer, Robert Scoble, David Weinberger, Shel Israel, Julie Leung and Josh Williams. Seth Godin even provided a quote for the cover. I hope to write another one some day.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite things are chai lattes, Arsenal, Rob Bell, the Grateful Dead, presidential campaigns, U2, West Wing,&nbsp;Richard Rorty,&nbsp;new ideas, live music and writing.</p>
<p>I met my wife, <a href="http://twitter.com/loribailey">Lori</a>, in 8th grade and I've been thanking God for her ever since. It's like Wonder Years if Kevin and Winnie had ended up together. We have a delightful, talented son, <a href="http://twitter.com/bennett">Ben</a>, who is in high school, but still enjoys hanging out and listening to Radiohead with me.</p>
<p>I love sharing life with creative and curious people. I hope you&rsquo;re one of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="http://twitter.com/bb">@bb on Twitter</a>. Say hello or <a href="mailto:brianbailey@gmail.com">drop me a note</a>.</p>
