<p>Hello, my name is Brian and I am the Team Leader and Project Manager at <a href="http://gowalla.com">Gowalla</a> in Austin, Texas. My job is to make things happen, keep things organized, and make sure balls aren't dropped. In that capacity, I'm heavily involved in art and technical project management, community management, content strategy and writing, and product direction. If you'd like to connect with me professionally, introduce yourself on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/brianbailey">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>Before Gowalla, I was a web director for four years. A few years ago, I wrote a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0787984876">book on blogging</a> that reached #3 on Amazon's Movers &amp; Shakers list and #148 overall. I know because I hit refresh often. It included contributions from Kathy Sierra, Guy Kawasaki, Merlin Mann, Dave Winer, Robert Scoble, David Weinberger, Shel Israel, and more. Seth Godin even provided a quote for the cover. I hope to write another one.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite things are chai lattes, Arsenal FC, Rob Bell, the Grateful Dead, presidential campaigns, U2, West Wing,&nbsp;Richard Rorty, <a href="http://www.politico.com/playbook/">Playbook</a>, listening to live music, writing, and chasing new ideas.</p>
<p>I met my wife, <a href="http://twitter.com/loribailey">Lori</a>, in 8th grade and I've been thanking God for her ever since. It's like Wonder Years if Kevin and Winnie had ended up together. We have a delightful, talented son, <a href="http://benbailey.me">Ben</a>, who is in high school, but still enjoys hanging out and listening to Radiohead with me.</p>
<p>I love sharing life with creative and curious people. I hope you&rsquo;re one of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="http://twitter.com/bb">@bb on Twitter</a>. Say hello or <a href="mailto:brianbailey@gmail.com">drop me a note</a>.</p>
